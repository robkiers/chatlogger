2/14 22:35:45.348  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "A shared feeling. I was hidding there when Thalyndrae found me. Might... not be a great place to hide, if you found us too..."
2/14 22:35:53.408  [4. LookingForGroup] Ðvy-ArgentDawn: shoulda done that with comp stomp 2 resets ago

2/14 22:36:12.111  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You are quite visible from the road and Thalyndrae stands out.
2/14 22:36:18.400  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: comp stomp was fast but i expected to get alot more honor

2/14 22:43:29.098  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: My pleasure. Have a good talk.
2/14 22:43:30.739  Irrissia-ArgentDawn waves gently.
2/14 22:43:36.089  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: It is quite fine, worry not.
2/14 22:43:47.106  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: She actually doesn't leave. Just straight turn to ice.
2/14 22:43:53.978  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: My fat fingers
2/14 22:43:57.510  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Huhu
2/14 22:43:57.510  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: That's cold
2/14 22:44:20.881  Irrissia-ArgentDawn turns fully, to face Arlien, extending her leg on the log to quit her curled-up sitting position.
2/14 22:44:30.343  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Did I do something bad...?
2/14 22:44:47.157  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, not at all.
2/14 22:45:11.170  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is about Tharandrel, and in particular about Elrinde. They showed some interest in joining the Hermitage, Gweryan told me.
2/14 22:45:48.296  Káthene has gone offline.

2/14 22:46:01.382  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: ...Yes ?
2/14 22:46:28.429  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I...am not sure what I'm suppose to say ? It's not really me to decide.
2/14 22:46:45.736  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: i hate that one
2/14 22:46:51.165  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/14 22:47:01.885  |Kq8|k whispers: (Even if OOC we could argue that maybe I should have an opinion about it, but eh. IC :p Tessa doesn't get a word. Yet.)
2/14 22:47:12.572  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Elrinde is atuned to the Arcane, and she will likely be able to sense your garden.
2/14 22:47:16.229  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: do i need jump tho, 30% is alot!
2/14 22:47:37.389  Irrissia-ArgentDawn draws her legs back against her chest. "Likely... But there is no garden yet."
2/14 22:47:46.910  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: it throws me off my game
2/14 22:48:13.227  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: its like the "you can't walk backwards" one
2/14 22:48:13.892  Arlièn-ArgentDawn nods: "That is true, but it is a consideration I have."
2/14 22:48:15.439  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: fucks me up
2/14 22:48:24.304  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: that one doenst sound bad at all
2/14 22:48:45.543  [4. LookingForGroup] Malmuth-ArgentDawn: there should be one that forces you to keyboard turn

2/14 22:49:51.416  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How will it impact you?
2/14 22:50:12.419  Irrissia-ArgentDawn seems to ponder the news, her gaze lost on the grass.
2/14 22:50:16.520  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: Lycara's Bargain i LOVE this one
2/14 22:50:22.672  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: its so funny

2/14 22:50:50.897  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: If she is to become one of the Hermitage...
2/14 22:51:12.230  Irrissia-ArgentDawn struggles a moment, her eyes glancing left and right, as if her focus was bothered by something.
2/14 22:51:25.731  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I take... she... should know ?
2/14 22:51:49.308  Annaeya has come online.
2/14 22:52:43.553  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "And as you said, there is no garden yet. You could get used to her and slowly introduce the idea. I have a feeling she might find it fascinating."
2/14 22:53:05.113  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: She does... She was very excited about it and... Well. She wanted to see my researches.
2/14 22:53:06.776  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: that lotr trailer looks fine to me idk I'm not a big lotr guy though
2/14 22:53:11.546  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It's... just... I don't know.
2/14 22:53:15.097  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: that does look nothing like my LOTR
2/14 22:53:17.515  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: They massacred my boi
2/14 22:53:20.121  Irrissia-ArgentDawn hugs her knees thighter.
2/14 22:53:26.982  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: felt more like some Witcher trailer
2/14 22:53:31.345  [4. LookingForGroup] Dìzàng-ArgentDawn: looks like narnia
2/14 22:53:45.478  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Look at the comments Keileel, Pog
2/14 22:53:56.445  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: why they all in russian though xd
2/14 22:54:20.148  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: it all translate to the same "What is evil can never make something good" or something like htat
2/14 22:54:26.248  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: aka amazon or w/e
2/14 22:55:10.297  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Will you give her a chance?
2/14 22:55:55.173  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Don't have much choice anyway..."
2/14 22:56:00.638  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: my prime trial runs out soon
2/14 22:56:17.438  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I need to find a way to watch F1 and support my dear Max Verstappen
2/14 22:56:46.341  [4. LookingForGroup] Malmuth-ArgentDawn: if Microsoft launch a streaming service they can make a Warcraft or Elder Scrolls series they will own the IP
2/14 22:56:57.392  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: And Minecraft
2/14 22:57:01.783  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If you strongly object, I might reconsider. But I would need a good reason, we owe her that.
2/14 22:57:25.740  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: They should make WoW serie/movies like the cinematics
2/14 22:57:41.407  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: all tho i dont wanna see a sylvanas version of legion
2/14 22:57:48.707  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn:  then give us a bfa version
2/14 22:58:27.695  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I have no reasons. She is nice and polite. That would be unfair.
2/14 22:59:05.445  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and nods encouragingly to Irrissia.
2/14 22:59:07.991  Irrissia-ArgentDawn hands find her ribbon, playing with the loose ends slowly.

2/14 23:01:56.721  Irrissia-ArgentDawn adjust a loose lock of hair back in her braid. "Just... do what you want. It's your choice in the end."
2/14 23:01:57.766  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Don't fret over it, I foresee on problem. But I wanted to take you with me in this discussion.
2/14 23:02:23.107  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I'm just... anxious. Tharandrel... wasn't always the most open on that question.
2/14 23:03:27.893  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How do you mean?
2/14 23:03:37.432  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: Man, Lycara's SashLycara's BargainSealed Essence SphereEnergy Focusing Crystal all together feels so good
2/14 23:03:57.849  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: He... said what I was doing was impossible, basically. Remember him arguing with Arandell about Tylwen project too.
2/14 23:04:06.748  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: TC is pretty fun for feeling like an absolutely broken towering machine of death
2/14 23:04:12.918  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I...I'm honestly more worry of his reactions, than hers.
2/14 23:04:18.852  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: for me its Necrotic Venom and Bone Barbs

2/14 23:05:37.233  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: The Hermitage newcomers aren't mine to decide. I-...I don't want people thinking I... I took that chance away from someone. I-if I create problems... I... I rather leave. I-... I don't have the strenght to face that again.
2/14 23:07:58.685  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "That is why I came to you, to talk with you about it."
2/14 23:08:39.562  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks towards the inn for a moment: "We already sit a while longer than I had intended, though I am willing to stay."
2/14 23:08:56.506  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears, muttering. "T-then... I will... be gone tomorrow. N-no, it's alright. I understand."
2/14 23:10:00.065  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Please don't say that. Don't hear the worst in what I ask.
2/14 23:10:18.210  Tharandrél has come online.
2/14 23:10:21.119  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If he wants to  join, he too will have to adhere to certain rules.
2/14 23:10:57.600  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And... what if he doesn't ?

2/14 23:11:51.888  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] At least, he will be...
2/14 23:12:06.919  Arlièn-ArgentDawn turns around to the sound of running, momentarily distracted.
2/14 23:12:28.638  Irrissia-ArgentDawn followed the duo running in their back with her eyes, starting to look tensed.
2/14 23:13:19.091  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ahem, at least he will be reprimanded, at worst he would be expelled. But that all depends on the situation and the circumstances.
2/14 23:13:49.102  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "When do you... Plan to introduce them ?"
2/14 23:14:26.908  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will still have to talk with them about it and speak with Vashira as well.
2/14 23:14:53.545  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: how many floors is TC? 18?
2/14 23:14:56.606  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods again. "So... a couple of nights at least..."

2/14 23:20:34.234  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It just... has been a difficult year. I hope the new one will be better. Still recovering from the Festival exhaustion...
2/14 23:21:13.958  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hear you about the festival. I have been catching up on some sleep as well.
2/14 23:21:28.497  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: does haste affect GDC?

2/14 23:22:46.570  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly, sliding from the trunk.
2/14 23:23:18.002  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: damn he died fast
2/14 23:23:23.935  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: threw 30-40k crits at him non stop
2/14 23:23:27.272  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I-... I just wanted to tell you. I'm not sure we will... get engaged with Selrian, actually. He left, weeks ago, and I have no news...
2/14 23:23:47.135  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks down. "That's... one of the reason why I looked so... off."
2/14 23:24:46.166  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods, frowning a little: "I...I hear you and I am sorry. I noticed he was not around much."
2/14 23:25:33.124  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: how did u get so many anima powers, ur doing diff layer then me?
2/14 23:25:40.857  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: im at 45 anima powers and im at floor 13 already, but u had 81 o.o
2/14 23:25:48.192  Irrissia-ArgentDawn adjusts another piece of her hair. "Not your fault. I just... hope he will be back to discuss it properly. B-but I... I will tell you if things change. Whatever the change."
2/14 23:26:08.298  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: are you fully clearing floors?
2/14 23:26:13.548  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: you're going WAY faster than me

2/14 23:26:25.550  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly.
2/14 23:26:32.910  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Well they call me Speedlix but not cause of WOW
2/14 23:26:33.931  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Shall we ?
2/14 23:26:34.239  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: FeelsBadMan
2/14 23:26:45.261  Thylendra has come online.

2/14 23:27:53.343  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But mainly butchering orcs spesificly now.
2/14 23:28:01.095  Vashíra bows before you.
2/14 23:28:03.319  Nitzuss bows before you.
2/14 23:28:04.325  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune Keeper
2/14 23:28:12.924  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Generally, killing should have a purpose though.
2/14 23:28:13.155  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Tessa and bows his head at Arlien.
2/14 23:28:15.258  Tharandrél-ArgentDawn assumed a dried piece of meat to munch on whilst the others spoke open-mindedly about slaughter.
2/14 23:28:17.223  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn inclines her head at the two.
2/14 23:28:19.167  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head in greeting: "Ishnu-alah."
2/14 23:28:21.484  Irrissia-ArgentDawn joins her hands silently, nodding slowly for the group gathered.
2/14 23:28:27.122  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune Tessa
2/14 23:28:33.098  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Suppose for a fun is a purpose, brother.
2/14 23:28:35.032  Dalathria-ArgentDawn bows her head to Arlièn and Tessaemay. "Good evening."
2/14 23:28:36.164  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, Elder Snowshade.
2/14 23:28:41.547  Tharandrél-ArgentDawn greeted the two with a bowing head.
2/14 23:28:42.511  Nitzuss bows before Irrissia.
2/14 23:28:48.282  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I got something for you Keeper
2/14 23:28:49.552  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, Arlien, Tessa.
2/14 23:28:54.167  Annaeya-ArgentDawn eyes the two new arrivals. 
2/14 23:29:04.893  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Tessa. Good to see you.
2/14 23:29:17.064  Vashíra-ArgentDawn takes her pouch and hands it over to Arlien, inside she can see quite a collection of coins "Earned this with my Kabob sales for the rebuild of the Hermitage"
2/14 23:29:17.708  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh? What may that be?
2/14 23:29:29.489  Irrissia-ArgentDawn smiles slighty for Nitzuss, seemingly low mood.
2/14 23:29:42.306  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: almost died oof
2/14 23:29:47.189  Faeraven-ArgentDawn picks the remaining crumbs until there were none. She then hops towards where she left the rock and drops it near Mak, only to have it fall off the roof.
2/14 23:29:52.635  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: i've died twice i think
2/14 23:30:12.561  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: ur allowed to die?
2/14 23:30:21.579  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and takes the pouch for a moment, weighing the heft of it: "This feels like quite a few coins. Well done"
2/14 23:30:30.673  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I would never have considered it.
2/14 23:30:35.844  [4. LookingForGroup] Polyfang-ArgentDawn: yeah, they removed the death limit
2/14 23:30:36.154  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I wonder if anyone else saw that Arlien was weary boots.
2/14 23:30:36.723  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: yeah look at your floor icon bar it has a gravestone icon on it thats how many deaths before wipe
2/14 23:30:37.796  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] People were generous
2/14 23:30:38.657  Vashíra smiles at you.
2/14 23:30:46.158  Makhalann-ArgentDawn tilts his head, looking at the falling rock. He glances at Ivyenna, inclining his big head "Hoot?"
2/14 23:30:47.601  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: TC still has death limit it seems
2/14 23:30:51.640  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Most came from the Sentinels
2/14 23:30:52.218  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: ow i got 5 remainings it says
2/14 23:30:54.885  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: it doesn't have empowerment
2/14 23:30:57.467  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: First thing to check.
2/14 23:30:58.486  [4. LookingForGroup] Polyfang-ArgentDawn: oh
2/14 23:31:01.529  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Vashíra.
2/14 23:31:02.287  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: It is highly unsettling.
2/14 23:31:08.321  Faeraven-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* Skraww...
2/14 23:31:28.185  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What...they asked how much it cost, I said any donations they could miss were welcome. Guess they could miss alot!
2/14 23:32:01.144  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Truelly? I am at a loss for words.
2/14 23:32:16.795  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I would never want to charge them for anything.
2/14 23:32:22.354  Makhalann-ArgentDawn swoops down, picking the stone again. He reaches the roof, letting it fall near Ivyenna before landing again
2/14 23:32:25.001  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I didn't charge for the Kabob
2/14 23:32:37.191  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I merely said they were welcome to donate anything but wasn't required.
2/14 23:32:41.593  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien sideway. "I think... 'Thank for your consideration to the Hermitages funds' would do well, next time you see them."
2/14 23:32:49.270  Faeraven-ArgentDawn tries to catch the rock into her beak before it falls off the roof again.
2/14 23:32:53.180  Arlièn-ArgentDawn offers the pouch back to Vashira: "Can you hand this to Gweryan when he comes around? Otherwise just bring it back to the Hermitage."
2/14 23:33:01.098  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances upwards with a raised eyebrow briefly before his attention returns to the conversation.
2/14 23:33:16.839  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/14 23:33:19.708  Vashíra-ArgentDawn takes the pouch back "Euh..alright"
2/14 23:33:25.814  Arlièn-ArgentDawn nods to Tessaemay.
2/14 23:33:49.758  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: What do you call Tim Burton falling over?
2/14 23:33:50.851  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I didn't charge anyone, they all just donated on their own accord if they liked. 
2/14 23:33:55.100  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: Timbuuuuuur-ton
2/14 23:34:00.130  [4. LookingForGroup] Kyoko-ArgentDawn: please--- hahahaha oh gosh
2/14 23:34:02.379  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: murder
2/14 23:34:02.379  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: DansGame
2/14 23:34:02.607  Annaeya-ArgentDawn tosses a small little stone into the air, in a perfect arch, hoping that nobody will notice its ascent. Only where it lands. That is, atop Arandell's head. Why? To make it look as though the rooftop druids were the culprits. 
2/14 23:34:03.597  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah, I hear you.
2/14 23:34:06.073  Faeraven-ArgentDawn extends her wings and takes off again, circling above Mak before letting the rock fall again.
2/14 23:34:10.681  Tharandrél-ArgentDawn stood with arms folded, his thoughts still churning on sinister things recently said, pondering what sort of people he is mingling with. Is feeling frightened justified? 
2/14 23:34:12.560  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I'm calling the police
2/14 23:34:12.560  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: >.<
2/14 23:34:21.178  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Gweryan is simply better with coin than I am, and he is more active with these nights.
2/14 23:34:29.564  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Also was given a twig, but i figured that won't do much for the Hermitage. Unless youlike twigs.
2/14 23:34:37.870  Nitzuss snickers at Vashíra.
2/14 23:34:39.794  Makhalann-ArgentDawn tries this time to catch it, extending his head and aiming his black beack
2/14 23:34:52.548  [4. LookingForGroup] Polyfang-ArgentDawn: I've got one:
2/14 23:34:54.560  [4. LookingForGroup] Polyfang-ArgentDawn: A dwarf walks out of a bar
2/14 23:34:55.314  [4. LookingForGroup] Doofenshmitz-ArgentDawn: PepegaPhone nothing to see here!
2/14 23:35:06.695  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] O, and there was a Idol, i put that in the bag too. It is suppose to bring us good luck.
2/14 23:35:16.756  Thyreena has come online.
2/14 23:35:23.101  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: A man walks into a bar
2/14 23:35:25.203  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Wait a minute
2/14 23:35:26.372  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: perry the platypus !?
2/14 23:35:28.748  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: he gets a concussion
2/14 23:35:34.857  [4. LookingForGroup] Doofenshmitz-ArgentDawn: a bar walks into a man!
2/14 23:35:37.400  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Twigs have their use, but not enough to warant it brought back to Astranaar.
2/14 23:35:47.775  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah? I did not notice that quickly.
2/14 23:35:50.168  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances upwards as small stone falls on him and noting the second falling stone. He looks towards the roof and then towards a certain bush.
2/14 23:36:11.102  Makhalann-ArgentDawn aim is not superb: the rock hits faintly his forehead, before bouncing and getting caught by his beak: also his owl form is missing an eye. He swoops up, waiting for Ivyenna to land again on the roof
2/14 23:36:15.334  Vashíra-ArgentDawn smiles
2/14 23:36:33.224  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It wasn't a big idol, but there were a lot of coins. Many of our kin have surprisingly many coins on them.
2/14 23:37:13.632  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: Behold! My ultimate joke-inator!
2/14 23:37:15.790  Dalathria-ArgentDawn quietly eyes Arandell, before eventually looking back to the general direction of the discussion.
2/14 23:37:36.143  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hear you. Though I never would have considered it.
2/14 23:37:42.495  Annaeya-ArgentDawn smacks her hands up against her lips in an attempt to hinder any laughter. 
2/14 23:37:51.517  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Neither did i, but here we are..a bag full!
2/14 23:37:58.917  Faeraven-ArgentDawn performs evasive maneuvers in the air as Mak takes the skies. She playfully tries to swoop towards him and hit him with her wing.
2/14 23:38:06.849  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: ffs i got feared into an edge i couldn't jump out of so i had to commit suicide
2/14 23:38:10.250  Vashíra-ArgentDawn puts the pouch away safely again
2/14 23:38:55.320  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: these elites becoming a pain in my bum
2/14 23:38:58.710  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: 400k hp DansGame
2/14 23:39:08.344  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: 464k even
2/14 23:39:12.845  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: you have 400k?
2/14 23:39:13.112  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and nods, looking towards a few bushes.
2/14 23:39:13.301  Arandell-ArgentDawn takes another glance upwards before moving.
2/14 23:39:15.027  Irrissia-ArgentDawn gaze gets lost on the ground a moment, her right hand shaking discretly.
2/14 23:39:29.163  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Yours?
2/14 23:39:37.784  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: 166k
2/14 23:39:45.333  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: jesus why are mine mini Raid bosses
2/14 23:39:59.385  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: oh no i mean thats my health
2/14 23:40:17.715  Arandell-ArgentDawn leans to peer of over the banister into the bushes.
2/14 23:40:29.340  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: oh no mine is still 106k
2/14 23:40:40.965  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: man is actually made out of uranium
2/14 23:40:41.933  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances around.
2/14 23:40:53.470  Nitzuss bows before Aseasia.
2/14 23:40:53.535  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: my next elite i can see has 1982k health
2/14 23:41:03.854  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: jesus christ monkey balls
2/14 23:41:04.127  Aseasia nods at Nitzuss.
2/14 23:41:04.980  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Looks like a siege soon.
2/14 23:41:18.024  You chuckle at Arandell.
2/14 23:41:24.587  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: 1982k is like 10 minute fight for me
2/14 23:41:25.622  Annaeya-ArgentDawn is quite well concealed, more than a year of hiding in bushes has left her in good stead, one would need to be -in- the bush to see past her camouflage.  Though if one listens, one can hear strangled chuckles. 
2/14 23:41:33.346  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head softly and moves next to Thalyndrae.
2/14 23:41:40.914  Lyndraé gently pats Irrissia.
2/14 23:41:52.351  Irrissia-ArgentDawn grabs the patting hand, to hold it. Mine.
2/14 23:41:57.532  Aseasia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is there.. a commotion with the bush?
2/14 23:41:57.911  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and dips her head to Aseasia in greeting, before she looks back to the bush.
2/14 23:42:03.397  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn has no choice.
2/14 23:42:13.341  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: do you want me to time how long it takes to kill for you
2/14 23:42:30.067  Aseasia-ArgentDawn returns a nod towards Arlien.
2/14 23:42:30.427  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i will just become sad probably hearing it being like 1 minute
2/14 23:42:31.545  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Producing very unusual sounds and berries, that really should not be growing.
2/14 23:42:31.545  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: How are you feeling?
2/14 23:42:59.392  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: if it takes longer than 5 seconds i'll honestly be kind of mad
2/14 23:43:00.613  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "Tired..."
2/14 23:43:04.809  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: >->
2/14 23:43:16.930  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: There's a general solution to that conundrum; it's called sleep.
2/14 23:43:27.868  Annaeya-ArgentDawn careflly reaches up, attempting to tuck a few daisies into one of Dalathria's boots without being noticed. 
2/14 23:43:29.089  Irrissia-ArgentDawn squints, looking at Thalyndrae Ravenshade.
2/14 23:43:36.649  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And you are the one telling about it ?
2/14 23:43:37.458  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am expecting crickets or some other bugs flying about.
2/14 23:43:39.289  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: it took about 4.5 seconds
2/14 23:43:44.211  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: for 2000k ?
2/14 23:43:47.152  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Precisely. Do what I say, not what I do.
2/14 23:43:47.646  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: jesus
2/14 23:43:55.105  Dalathria-ArgentDawn glances over her shoulder towards the unknown voice and inclines her head to Aseasia slightly.
2/14 23:43:58.571  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i only do 100k crit with kill shot and that requires me to put them down to 20%
2/14 23:43:59.427  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: convoke with all these damage buffs is insane
2/14 23:44:24.964  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You know it doesn't work well with me.
2/14 23:44:52.906  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Sleep might though.
2/14 23:44:54.749  Annaeya-ArgentDawn does not reveal herself,  despite having been well and truly rumbled. 
2/14 23:44:55.234  |Hchannel:228299792|h[Rylund]|h Moderation privileges given to (null).
2/14 23:44:55.234  |Hchannel:228300064|h[Rylund-ArgentDawn]|h Owner changed to (null).
2/14 23:44:56.891  Faeraven-ArgentDawn shrieks playfully and hastens her flight. She swoops agilely across the air and changes her directions unpredictably, enjoying the chase.
2/14 23:45:05.610  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her gaze, mumbling faintly.
2/14 23:45:07.385  Dalathria-ArgentDawn eventually turns her attention back to the bush, paying little attention to her boots.
2/14 23:45:28.928  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn leans to mumble back.
2/14 23:45:37.213  Annaeya-ArgentDawn continues to decorate Dalathria's boots, one little daisy and buttercup at a time.
2/14 23:45:59.219  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly.
2/14 23:46:06.604  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Low] Likely.
2/14 23:46:13.363  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: Twisting Corridors: Layer 4 i was on layer 4 Gim
2/14 23:46:15.685  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Ah. So this is how the druid with stuff growing up on his feet does it...
2/14 23:46:29.186  Aseasia-ArgentDawn makes her up closer to the bush.
2/14 23:46:30.980  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When you are done there, will you come out?
2/14 23:46:31.826  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Well, I'm not leaving anytime soon, so there's that.
2/14 23:46:34.424  Lyndraé shrugs at Irrissia. Who knows?
2/14 23:47:15.049  Annaeya-ArgentDawn ponders Arlien's query. One last flower is added to Dalathria's boot before she utters. "Nope!"
2/14 23:47:25.232  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods again, her focus switchin on the bush a moment.
2/14 23:47:33.304  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Low] What's the problem, with the bush...?
2/14 23:47:40.696  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No as in you are not done yet, or no you will not come out?
2/14 23:48:05.853  Annaeya-ArgentDawn manages to hear Tessaemay despite her low voice. Good ears, this elf. "The bush is haunted!"
2/14 23:48:20.836  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I think it came to life, but I'm not sure.
2/14 23:48:33.749  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not another water spirit?
2/14 23:48:34.294  Annaeya-ArgentDawn says: No I am not done and no I will not come out... so... both!
2/14 23:48:40.558  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/14 23:48:42.789  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stares blankly at the push, a moment of surprise passing. "Haunted with Anna's voice. Wonder what's spirit it could be."
2/14 23:48:56.989  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances over his shoulder towards Thalyndrae. "To be honest, would be less strange than someone hiding in it at this point."
2/14 23:49:13.989  Irrissia-ArgentDawn grabs the other hand of Thalyndrae, completly panicked. "No ! No you can't !"
2/14 23:49:14.555  Dalathria-ArgentDawn lets out a quiet chuckle and finally looks down, noticing the decorations on her boots.
2/14 23:49:20.088  Lyndraé pouts at Irrissia.
2/14 23:49:33.248  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: So authoritarian...
2/14 23:49:38.339  Annaeya-ArgentDawn sighs, pushing herself upright, and stepping out of the bush. Grinning, though her mouth cannot be seen her wyes certainly glimmer with amusement. 
2/14 23:50:00.441  Lyndraé frowns with disappointment at Irrissia.
2/14 23:50:35.348  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well I'm off to do my chores
2/14 23:50:39.584  Irrissia-ArgentDawn eyes widdens as her hands relase Thalyndrae, escaping a hiccup, her hands shaking.
2/14 23:50:43.189  Nitzuss bows before Vashíra.
2/14 23:50:43.317  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goddess watch over you all
2/14 23:50:44.236  Vashíra bows before Astranaar Thrower.
2/14 23:50:47.796  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles to Annaeya, looking her over: "You are looking well."
2/14 23:50:48.822  Aseasia nods at Vashíra.
2/14 23:50:49.802  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/14 23:50:52.014  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Be well, sister. Always a pleasure.
2/14 23:50:52.780  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Vashíra.
2/14 23:50:53.287  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Vashira.
2/14 23:51:00.196  Dalathria-ArgentDawn nods to Vashíra. "Goddess watch over you."
2/14 23:51:01.934  Vashíra smiles at Nitzuss.
2/14 23:51:03.782  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Be carefull around the bushes tonight, Raven.
2/14 23:51:04.988  Thyreena peers at Irrissia searchingly.
2/14 23:51:09.521  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May our troubles be diminished, Vashira.
2/14 23:51:22.625  Thyreena-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is everything alright?
2/14 23:51:31.201  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: why eveyone new come around, it's when Tessa is loosing her shit ?
2/14 23:51:49.621  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: goodnight all
2/14 23:51:51.720  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: night all!
2/14 23:51:54.521  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: G'night!
2/14 23:51:59.654  Vashíra has gone offline.
2/14 23:51:59.889  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: night Vash, sleep well
2/14 23:52:01.354  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her gaze on the ground, clenchinf her fists in an attempt to stop the shaking.
2/14 23:52:04.754  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Nn vash !
2/14 23:52:06.980  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Not really new people...
2/14 23:52:07.665  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: G'night
2/14 23:52:25.373  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn tries to grasp Tessa's fists in her palm and stroke them softly, soothing her.
2/14 23:52:43.946  Thyreena-ArgentDawn peers between Tessaemay and Thalyndrae, arching a brow.
2/14 23:53:01.554  Nitzuss smirks slyly at Annaeya.
2/14 23:53:22.132  Allyissa-ArgentDawn says: Ishnu'alah. What are we looking at?
2/14 23:53:24.492  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles faintly, to answer Thyreena. "All... fine. I'm just... tired."
2/14 23:53:37.030  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Those hoods that hide the eyebrows look freaky af.
2/14 23:53:38.798  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Did you take time to listen?
2/14 23:54:19.614  Irrissia-ArgentDawn seems to calm down progressivly, as her hands are hold by Thalyndrae. She inhales slowly, mastering her breathing.
2/14 23:54:32.126  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: floor 16
2/14 23:54:33.259  Thyreena-ArgentDawn 's gaze lingers on Tessaemay, eyeing her over briefly. She likely didn't entirely believe her. Eventually she glances to her left instead, not pressing her further.
2/14 23:54:46.912  Annaeya-ArgentDawn tilts her head slightly. "Listen to what?" She asked curiously. Before pulling the mask away from her features, revealing her face. 
2/14 23:55:47.225  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The seed I gave you, a little while ago.
2/14 23:56:27.987  |Kq8|k whispers: Psst. Check discord when you have 2s
2/14 23:56:30.833  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances over his shoulder to dip his head towards Thyreena before leaning on his elbows on the banister.
2/14 23:56:50.734  Annaeya-ArgentDawn whispers: ((Pls remind me about the seed, I've had the months from hell lately xD brain is fried!
2/14 23:57:06.703  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods gently, moving to hold Thalyndrae's arm, resting her head against her shoulder, drained.
2/14 23:57:15.833  To Annaeya-ArgentDawn: Arlièn gave you an acorn, that she should listen to and tell her later what she hears in the song it produced
2/14 23:57:20.907  Thyreena-ArgentDawn nods to Arandell.
2/14 23:57:26.655  To Annaeya-ArgentDawn: Hope you are doing better again?
2/14 23:57:44.731  Lyndraé gently pats Irrissia.
2/14 23:57:53.532  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks over Annaeya, walking from side to side to make sure she is alright.
2/14 23:57:54.246  Thyreena-ArgentDawn peers ahead and hums.
2/14 23:58:17.669  To |Kq8|k: Already dropped a big invite bomb earlier too
2/14 23:58:43.989  |Kq8|k whispers: Ah ?
2/14 23:58:50.157  Annaeya-ArgentDawn tilts her head. Lifting a four fingered hand to scratch her cheek a little. "Oh... well it was sleeping. It still is. But last I listened, it is starting to stir from its slumber, mhmm!"  Annaeya's hair is messy but her attire is actually rather clean »
2/14 23:58:50.690  Annaeya-ArgentDawn » and crisp. Though her face is also smudged with some small amount of dirt. One notable thing is that somethings are moving beneath her hair. 
2/14 23:59:03.246  Aseasia-ArgentDawn places her hands on her weapons, holding a tight grip arond them.
2/14 23:59:19.527  Annaeya-ArgentDawn whispers: Starting to... but then just as I started to RP dog took a shit right behind my chair. Feels like a bad omen xD
2/14 23:59:19.527  |Kq8|k whispers: OH on the calendar
2/14 23:59:29.581  To Annaeya-ArgentDawn: uhoh
2/14 23:59:42.398  Annaeya-ArgentDawn whispers: Hence the slowness xD
2/14 23:59:53.201  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm, I would still like you to put to words what you hear now.
2/14 23:59:59.303  Thyreena-ArgentDawn utters a quiet "Interesting.." beneath her breath, before strolling off.
2/15 00:00:52.955  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Once you have done that, we can see to burying it somewhere.
2/15 00:01:27.875  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: first death jesus
2/15 00:01:35.142  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: not fair having 1 spot with 20 mobs -.-
2/15 00:02:02.254  Annaeya-ArgentDawn reaches into one of the pouches at her belt. Plucking free a ball of moss, inside of the moss is the acorn she was gifted some weeks ago. She holds it up to her ear. "Tired. Happy... uncertain. Like most wild things lately." She holds the acorn out. 
2/15 00:02:18.503  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: makes me more mad seeing that A Taste of Perfection requires 0 deaths
2/15 00:02:34.379  Annaeya-ArgentDawn | A small moth suddenly bursts free from Annaeya's hair. Fluttering around aimlessly before opting to attempt to land on Arandell's forehead. 
2/15 00:02:36.412  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: yeah but you dont need to do that in TC
2/15 00:02:48.893  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: much easier to do layer 1 of a normal 5 floor run
2/15 00:02:58.945  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: ah good
2/15 00:03:05.829  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: was not fair, all mobs were attacking some Faeleaf tender 
2/15 00:03:15.260  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: and legit were 10 ghosts +3 elites all stacked on eachother -.-
2/15 00:03:27.671  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: just convoke the spirits?
2/15 00:03:40.450  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: My convoke isnt that OP
2/15 00:03:46.401  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good, good. With that in mind, can you repeat it's song?
2/15 00:03:49.387  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: does 4k crits on mobs that have 800k hp
2/15 00:03:50.264  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: should've rolled the best class
2/15 00:04:08.139  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn leans in on her stave, watching curiously.
2/15 00:04:28.037  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: DansGame
2/15 00:04:30.659  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: But i already am Hunter
2/15 00:04:40.777  Annaeya-ArgentDawn blinks. "Sing? It's song? I..." She shakes her head. "Nope. Can't do that! Only druid I know who can is you.... oh oh... and that other elf who likes to bite people when she's pretending to be a deer!"
2/15 00:04:44.907  Arandell-ArgentDawn lets out a huff as the moth approaches followed by wrinkling his nose and attempts to scare the moth off with his hand.
2/15 00:04:45.432  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: did you make it already btw? im still at 16
2/15 00:04:53.302  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: yeah i got done a little while ago
2/15 00:05:06.146  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: legit takes me forever killing 1 elite
2/15 00:05:19.843  Faeraven-ArgentDawn | The few seconds of falling soon prove to be a ruse. Ivyenna corrects her course at last second and climbs up in the air once again, but this time just enough to get on the roof where she heats herself, panting quietly in her birdlike fashion.
2/15 00:05:41.760  Annaeya-ArgentDawn | The moth flutters away as it is swatted at, circling around Arandell and slowly fluttering toward Tessaemay. 
2/15 00:05:53.531  Dalathria-ArgentDawn watches the exhange, her expression changing between amused and confused.
2/15 00:06:27.037  Makhalann-ArgentDawn swoops down, landing near her among a gust of dust. He tilts his head to her, him too quite tired
2/15 00:06:32.175  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would you try? You need not do it now, but I would like to hear you attempt it.
2/15 00:06:42.391  Arandell-ArgentDawn keeps looking at the moth with an approving nod as it seems approach Tessa. "More appriciated there."
2/15 00:07:12.134  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn (Tessa is afk for a min, she'll be back)
2/15 00:07:23.518  Faeraven-ArgentDawn holds her beak open slightly, tired but satisfied.
2/15 00:07:23.866  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] With the thoughts and the emotions, try to get to it as closely as you can.
2/15 00:07:56.076  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/15 00:07:57.709  Annaeya-ArgentDawn peers sideways. Perhaps almost looking too scared to make the attempt more so than anything else. "Hmmm... I'll try but the pitch is a little high..." She clears her throat and stares at  the druidess in thought for a moment. 
2/15 00:08:20.209  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks at the sky, hooting quietly, and calmly
2/15 00:08:20.708  Irrissia-ArgentDawn (back)
2/15 00:08:27.877  [9. Community:159037872:1] Annaeya-ArgentDawn: Time to shatter Arandell's eardrums >:D
2/15 00:08:42.190  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Just his?
2/15 00:08:42.190  Faeraven-ArgentDawn looks towards Mak and caws softly. 
2/15 00:09:20.441  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks back at her, hooting again and brushing the tip of one of his wings on her head, gently, before folding it again against his body
2/15 00:09:30.654  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As I said, you need not do it now. Even for a little thing, it is complex.
2/15 00:09:59.740  Annaeya-ArgentDawn parts  her lips letting out a single off key note. Wrinkling her nose. She will do this for a few minutes as she tries to figure out how to sing the first note. It could take hours... days... weeks to learn to sing it. But then Arlien probably knows »
2/15 00:09:59.939  Annaeya-ArgentDawn » this already. 
2/15 00:10:33.093  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks up at the moth after a moment of asbence, if it's still hear. She tils her head slightly and offers it a finger to land, keep her other hand to hold on Thalyndrae.
2/15 00:10:39.360  Annaeya-ArgentDawn relents, letting out a slight huff. "I'll hm... try to practice some."
2/15 00:11:06.029  Arandell-ArgentDawn blinks once or twice before saying towards Dalathria. "Think you need bit more practise to sound like druids."
2/15 00:11:16.343  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: still at floor 16 DansGame
2/15 00:11:40.977  Annaeya-ArgentDawn | The silver winged moth sits upon Tessaemay's finger, fluttering those beautiful reflective wings. 
2/15 00:11:42.705  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If it helps you, you could try an instrument as well. A flute normally.
2/15 00:11:48.855  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ...Ehh.
2/15 00:11:57.314  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Sophiá.
2/15 00:12:11.866  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] About the earlier. Talking like one.
2/15 00:12:19.330  Annaeya-ArgentDawn nods her head hurriedly. "I suppose that's why they choose flutes! The pitch is probably easily to find with a flute..."
2/15 00:12:23.762  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: so we'll be able to equip covenant legendary+normal in 9.2?
2/15 00:12:37.894  [4. LookingForGroup] Frostland-ArgentDawn: Correct but the covenant legendary is a bit weird
2/15 00:12:38.957  Irrissia-ArgentDawn oddly breaks from her tired and scared stance to adopt a more joyful one her eyes looking at the moth as she hums softly for the small insect, friendly.
2/15 00:12:43.572  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: how come?
2/15 00:12:45.893  [4. LookingForGroup] Frostland-ArgentDawn: so don't craft it just yet
2/15 00:12:54.748  Dalathria-ArgentDawn narrows her eyes at Arandell. "What are you on about?"
2/15 00:12:57.035  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They?
2/15 00:12:57.763  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: how do you mean?
2/15 00:13:07.930  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles and shakes his head.
2/15 00:13:15.363  [4. LookingForGroup] Frostland-ArgentDawn: Honestly not sure, haven't looked into it too deeply but it seems to me you don't make the covenant legendary, rather a legendary that gives you the covenant leggo effect
2/15 00:13:21.964  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing important.
2/15 00:13:31.930  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Uh-huh...
2/15 00:13:36.563  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: that's so stupid
2/15 00:13:50.297  Annaeya-ArgentDawn | A total of four moths break loose from Annaeya's hair. This is certainly a new thing, keeping moths on her scalp. And they all make for Tessaemay, fluttering around her as she sings for them. Ananeya doesn't even so much as flinch. As though this »
2/15 00:13:50.530  Annaeya-ArgentDawn » were all absolutely normal and not odd at all.
2/15 00:14:05.763  [4. LookingForGroup] Frostland-ArgentDawn: Eeerm, actually, it's not too bad if you are like me who plays 3 specs and switches between covenants
2/15 00:14:11.497  Annaeya-ArgentDawn says: Druids about the forests. Many have flutes. Do they not?
2/15 00:14:23.996  [4. LookingForGroup] Frostland-ArgentDawn: so I don't need 2-3 different covenant legendaries, one is enough
2/15 00:14:29.311  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: that's way too dedicated
2/15 00:14:49.352  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is true. You said as though you were thinking of someone specific, it had me curious.
2/15 00:15:07.072  Arandell-ArgentDawn peers at the moths for a moment. "Her on the other hand. Concerning."
2/15 00:15:10.545  [4. LookingForGroup] Frostland-ArgentDawn: Yeah but see, for someone playing 1spec/covenant, you just make 1 leggo and it won't make a difference. For me, it makes a big difference. So it seems like a win :)

2/15 00:15:20.543  Irrissia-ArgentDawn blinks as more moths approaches, startled at first, before relaxing as she fly around her. She whistles gently her head bobbing to the rythm of her melody, her eyes shimering a glimmer of purple, her feathures switching to a more happier face.
2/15 00:15:22.500  Annaeya-ArgentDawn says: Well the druidess who bites... but I don't think you've met her! Or you might have. She's worse than even I am for hiding!
2/15 00:16:07.363  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn snickers softly.
2/15 00:16:12.490  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What did she sound like?
2/15 00:16:14.387  Faeraven-ArgentDawn bows her head and takes the skies once more, heading towards the hills circling the lake. Her shape fades into the horizon as distance grows.
2/15 00:16:41.318  Annaeya-ArgentDawn | The moths, five in total if one includes the moth already settled. Would all seek refuge on Tessaemay, turning her dress into a living silvery silk of sorts. 
2/15 00:16:49.527  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: damn i insta died by 1 hit with full hp
2/15 00:17:02.909  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: I see what you mean but it mildly inconveniences me, and I don't like that
2/15 00:17:49.803  Makhalann-ArgentDawn lands heavily unto the ground, quickly shifting back. He raises, shaking his hooded head and grunting low
2/15 00:17:59.442  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks back to Annaeya after she was startled by the deathkinght.
2/15 00:18:18.945  Irrissia-ArgentDawn escapes a childish giggle, interrupting her song as she observes the moths landing on her dress. She releases Thalyndrae waving a small light in her hands, shifting it around her following the song she is whistling, likely to play with her newly-met »
2/15 00:18:18.945  Irrissia-ArgentDawn » friends.
2/15 00:18:21.113  Annaeya-ArgentDawn peered over her shoulder as if to check as to where her 'friends' had got to. Peering at the moths for a moment before looking back to Arlien. "As though Aessina herself were singing!" Annaeya does have a way of over exaggerating, one must keep that in »
2/15 00:18:21.347  Annaeya-ArgentDawn » mind. 
2/15 00:18:36.228  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune to you as well, Makhalann.
2/15 00:18:37.471  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/15 00:18:47.236  Makhalann-ArgentDawn bows his head at Tessa and Arlien, in a silent and polite greeting
2/15 00:18:53.320  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: I wish the fishing artifact wasn't such a pain to get on an alt
2/15 00:19:14.744  Irrissia-ArgentDawn seems just too absorded by the moths around her to realise stuffs are happening around.

2/15 00:22:32.287  Makhalann-ArgentDawn pants a bit
2/15 00:22:59.229  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn leans idly on her stave, chin on top of it. She beams brightly at Tessa and the moths dancing around her.
2/15 00:23:06.486  Annaeya-ArgentDawn follows Arlien's gaze. "We can plant the acorn sometime this week if you like." She looked back to the druidess with some degree of hopefulness. 
2/15 00:23:31.167  Annaeya-ArgentDawn says: It is the right month to plant them, is it not?
2/15 00:23:32.312  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We could. But first I will want to hear you sing.
2/15 00:24:10.971  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Twisting Corridors: Layer 1 finally
2/15 00:24:39.405  Annaeya-ArgentDawn 's long ears wilt a little. Clearly she is quite shy about her singing. Though she does eventually answer. "Deal!" And grins in her usual blithe manner. "Though I should be going elder." She dips her head into a light bow. 
2/15 00:25:27.529  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and nods to Annaeya: "So should I. It was good to see you again in good health and high spirit."
2/15 00:26:05.486  Irrissia-ArgentDawn moves her arms with the light around her, her eyes half-closed, in a sort of dance, as she whistles the end of her greeting song, opening her eyes to observe the moths on her dress, keeping her arms slightly open to avoid touching any of them.
2/15 00:26:25.613  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: How convenient it is for me that Arandell is NOT looking in that direction.
2/15 00:27:15.382  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: You really think he is not aware that from now on we can just hand a moth to Tessa when things go bad? :P
2/15 00:27:28.435  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: Nice one
2/15 00:27:36.154  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Also, when did Makhalann get an upgrade?
2/15 00:27:36.444  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: :p More about the dancing.
2/15 00:27:38.484  Annaeya-ArgentDawn smiles warmly. Peering over her shoulder then at Dalathria's boots... for whatever reason. However, as Annaeya departs. Tessaemay will note that one by one the moths lift off and flutter after the 'grell', settling back into  her hair as though they »
2/15 00:27:38.725  Annaeya-ArgentDawn » were always there. Never having left. "Elune's blessings sisters and brother!" She calls in her wake. 
2/15 00:27:47.807  Nitzuss waves at Annaeya.
2/15 00:27:51.111  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Annaeya.
2/15 00:28:15.072  Irrissia-ArgentDawn observes the moths leave, one after another and seems to shift for a more quiet self, but her smile remains.
2/15 00:28:20.392  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: last night I had a little event to try to find some peace in my mind, retrieving the old family name with the help of Ivyenna near Hyjal
2/15 00:28:38.069  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Aah.
2/15 00:28:43.720  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: badass
2/15 00:28:45.175  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: ooh, fancy that
2/15 00:28:57.277  [9. Community:159037872:1] Annaeya-ArgentDawn: That was a subtle af dig at Arandel by the way >:D
2/15 00:29:18.369  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: ^^
2/15 00:29:24.316  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: And you can toss her wisp too, Aran. Work even better than moth
2/15 00:30:13.233  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing urgent, elder, but there was some highborne friend from past times asking about you. Think Nitzuss at least got her name.
2/15 00:30:13.527  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is only just past midnight, but I should return to the Hermitage again.
2/15 00:30:26.788  Irrissia-ArgentDawn idly takes Thalyndrae's arm again, resting her head against it.
2/15 00:30:34.985  Arlièn-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow and looks from Arandell to Nitzuss.
2/15 00:30:39.175  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Arlièn Snowshade, politely.
2/15 00:30:48.093  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: IC he is carrying the old carving tools of his father at his belt, with a little leather inscription that bears the name Warpath
2/15 00:30:53.105  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Oh yes. Not in plural. How rude.
2/15 00:30:58.004  Makhalann-ArgentDawn bows deeply to Arlien
2/15 00:31:13.446  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Well, you can toss multiple wisps if you wqnt
2/15 00:31:16.953  Makhalann-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] (brb)
2/15 00:31:20.661  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: It's just rare to find more than one at once xD
2/15 00:31:24.322  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: No, what the grell said.
2/15 00:31:26.032  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh? Who might it have been?
2/15 00:31:27.198  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mm, I'm not sure I got her name.
2/15 00:31:28.150  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Oh
2/15 00:31:40.326  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ophyra.. Moonstrider?
2/15 00:31:48.872  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Aran does not carry a random supply of wisps. :P
2/15 00:32:37.611  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She was visiting, greeted us here and was asking around.
2/15 00:33:03.835  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I thought I recognised her earlier, though I had not quite put her name to the face.
2/15 00:33:20.882  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods softly.
2/15 00:33:28.807  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: I figured she was familiar, but who she was again? Wasn't she from the felwood family?
2/15 00:33:31.486  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Have you met my friend here, Aseasia?
2/15 00:34:14.911  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: I don't actually know. She just said you and Dawnwind where good to her even when she was exile as highborne and not allowed to visit.
2/15 00:34:24.461  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We've been on patrol a few times these past weeks.
2/15 00:34:50.524  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: I think I vaguely recall her, but of what dealings you had, I dunno. I was hoping to learn that by informing... :P
2/15 00:35:10.381  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is a pleasure to meet you proper.
2/15 00:35:39.645  Makhalann-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] (back)
2/15 00:35:46.386  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Aseasia.
2/15 00:35:51.827  Nitzuss smiles at Aseasia.
2/15 00:36:07.662  Aseasia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I.. don't know about patrols, but we'ven talking. And sure. You too. Nitzuss had been wanting to introduce me to you. Aseasia... Dawnwhisper.
2/15 00:36:31.462  Makhalann-ArgentDawn face dons again a grim, deep shadow. He hums at the gathering "Time for me to find some rest" bowing his head under the hood
2/15 00:36:39.221  Aseasia-ArgentDawn nods her head towards Arlien, moving her lips inwards as she nods. 
2/15 00:36:51.859  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Makhalann.
2/15 00:36:57.648  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Rest well, brother.
2/15 00:36:59.651  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Makhalann.
2/15 00:37:04.330  Nitzuss bows before Makhalann.
2/15 00:37:13.519  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arlièn Snowshade. I have seen you about and I do think we shared a few words.
2/15 00:37:22.893  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Makhalann, will you head to the Hermitage?
2/15 00:37:23.541  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Makhalann Warpath, politely.
2/15 00:37:24.457  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Rest easy, brother. See you soon.
2/15 00:37:41.869  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien "If needed, yes. I have no place to go Elder"
2/15 00:38:07.511  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let us walk a ways together then.
2/15 00:38:26.495  Makhalann-ArgentDawn bows his head again "Of course"
2/15 00:38:28.171  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I shall retreat for now. I'll seek you out afterwards, Tessa?
2/15 00:38:30.661  Aseasia-ArgentDawn nods towards Makhalann, "Elune Adore, brother." Aseasia turns her head back to Arlien, "Very little words, sure. But you seem busy most of the time. I... respect that."
2/15 00:38:45.560  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: O-oh, well...
2/15 00:38:49.469  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Arlien...?
2/15 00:38:50.883  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thank you, Sister. I fear I must take my leave again as well now.

2/15 00:40:04.029  Arandell-ArgentDawn wrinkles his nose briefly.
2/15 00:40:13.258  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It's;.. The Hermitage, I rather ask.

2/15 00:40:22.897  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: May Aessina protects you both.

2/15 22:36:40.590  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: tell em it's a mystery :P
2/15 22:36:48.756  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yeah :p Not tessa
2/15 22:37:00.390  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Just do a cardtrick!
2/15 22:37:08.856  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: xD
2/15 22:37:11.223  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: A-what ? x)
2/15 22:37:40.056  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Every magician can do a cardtrick..it's magic!
2/15 22:40:26.555  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: W-well... They are. A-and I... shouldn't tell anything about. Thyreena w-was looking for you b-but you weren't there a-and... I though... I could answer them as much...
2/15 22:40:40.813  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It was had. The one about Feralas that is. I meant the 'could be worse' part.
2/15 22:40:41.646  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her gaze on her cup of tea, disappointed. "B-but probably... not."
2/15 22:41:02.459  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Probably not? What exactly happened? I don't need to know the details, just what brought you in this state.
2/15 22:41:47.454  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: T-the commander was just... asking me questions b-but I'm not... even sure she listened to my answers. A-and most of them seemed just to not... really care.
2/15 22:41:52.800  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh... Fair enough. I would imagine it will not be too bad.
2/15 22:42:02.930  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Thyreena didn't told me... it would be like that. I-I was suppose to speak w-with Ialluen...
2/15 22:42:14.029  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Was there anything planned for tonight?>
2/15 22:42:15.443  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums a greeting: "Ishnu-alah."
2/15 22:42:21.161  Arandell-ArgentDawn bows his head towards Arlien and gestures slightly towards the conversation on his right.
2/15 22:42:52.182  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: I was planning on, but I only just got online myself. Feel like doing something still?
2/15 22:42:53.030  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Sentinels are more retained and contempt with their reactions... You might not see many traces of emotions on their face.
2/15 22:43:03.403  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It better not. I do want to have the talk about the possible future, rather than a damned goodbye.
2/15 22:43:16.483  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: TO be honest, not really. Been a crappy shift tonight
2/15 22:43:51.649  Arlièn-ArgentDawn nods to Arandell, listening carefully as she picks up a cup of tea from Nantar.
2/15 22:43:52.275  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... Time will tell on that then. Shall say a prayer for it.
2/15 22:43:55.653  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Perhaps... I just... don't understand w-why Thyreena asked me... They even... shoo away another mage they seemed t-to know...
2/15 22:44:06.834  Lyndraé shrugs at Irrissia. Who knows?
2/15 22:44:15.952  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Then we don't. Annoying customers, or annoying bosses?
2/15 22:44:16.253  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: S-so... I don't mind helping b-but... felt like I was... more of a bother... than anything else.
2/15 22:44:24.592  Irrissia-ArgentDawn rests her head against Thalyndrae, depressed.
2/15 22:44:26.419  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I can't know what's going on in another's head. Perhaps they saw you as my protegee, given they were looking for me, but I can't tell for sure. But you should feel honoured they did.
2/15 22:45:14.756  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Maybe Nitzuss and Makhalann, hmm.
2/15 22:45:40.192  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: All my lines tonight didn't had enough time...constantly driving behind time. It's tiresome. You just wonder "Am i that smart or is the rest of the world so stupid?". It's not secret i have a very low opinion about higher educated people at a office, »
2/15 22:45:40.192  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » and they keep on proofing me why HBO doesn't mean you are smarter then me the "dumb" MBO'er
2/15 22:46:16.260  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm, my favorite. Waiting for unknown periods of time...
2/15 22:46:52.775  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn did not cast frost nova.
2/15 22:47:08.381  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Don't feel honoured."
2/15 22:47:14.581  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Oh great. Well done highborne. Now all the tea is cold. 
2/15 22:47:17.482  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: :P
2/15 22:47:19.902  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: xD
2/15 22:47:29.013  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Blame it on my internet, I had to test it with something.
2/15 22:47:38.863  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Iced tea is the best though.
2/15 22:47:54.024  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Hehe. Well, at least it is not the deadly crowd control.
2/15 22:47:55.698  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Did they tell you any of this or are these all just your worries?
2/15 22:48:14.191  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh yes... The lovely part of matters. Just waiting without much you can do.
2/15 22:48:21.724  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: I play Frost, dw
2/15 22:48:39.359  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: blind for the reality of the road, not wanting to look away from the models and screens.
2/15 22:48:57.156  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: We really need to re-evaluate things in the Netherlands with degrees. Why do we see HBO and higher as the holy grail when the dumbest people ever are the "higher" educated people. Why do i constantly hear I'm not smart enough, I don't get it, blahblah, »
2/15 22:48:57.159  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » yet none of htem office clowns understands that if something doesn't work in practice, then your theory means jackshit. Stop idolizing numbers and booksmart, start appreaciating people who do the real work, who get shit done even though some idiots »
2/15 22:48:57.159  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » at a office say it can be done in much less time cause that is more cost efficiant....then not realizing that when we are delayed for more then 2 minutes, they get thousands of euro;s fines...so how is it cheaper to cut our lines short, resulting us »
2/15 22:48:57.159  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » in always comming 3 or 4 minutes late...resulting into much higher costs then if they would give us just 3 to 4 minutes more for our freaking line
2/15 22:48:58.036  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Or maybe they think a bus drives just as quickly as a car, and are just using google maps to plot courses.
2/15 22:49:12.380  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: O they defenitely use google maps
2/15 22:49:32.395  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Could make a nice and dark comment about something that should've happened during the war, but I think I'll refrain this time.
2/15 22:49:39.585  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Not even that, they started to use a new program. I think they bought that software at wish.com cause not even google maps say it can be done in such short times
2/15 22:49:42.074  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "They just... mostly acted... as if I w-wasn't here. O-or... they were expecting m-me to answer to so vague questions... could have quoted all m-my books, that's how wide their questions were... Felt like I was highly incompetent w-when I »
2/15 22:49:42.318  Irrissia-ArgentDawn » didn't even know... why I was here in the first p-place. Thyreena asked me a thi-thing but the commander a whole... different one..."
2/15 22:50:17.259  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: And then they go "Well there are just some minor bugs, nothing major" nothing major? If i need 15 minutes, and you give me 10..that is a major freaking problem!
2/15 22:50:21.832  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: They probably wanted to give away as little information as possible and asked questions of you that, to an outsider, may seem vague and pointless, but they had their reasons for asking them.
2/15 22:51:08.850  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: The new software doens't keep busstops in mind, doesn't think of red lights, doesn't keep track of the busy parts of the line that slow you down. nope, it goes into full blown "Most ideal situation, minus 5 minutes"
2/15 22:51:14.595  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles, still clearly depressed by the exchange, her forehead hidding against Thalyndrae's chest. "A-and what am I suppose to answer...? All the theorical magic I-I know ?"
2/15 22:51:22.381  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nice and dark, being rather curious combination... Yes, perhaps that to be saved for another time.

2/15 22:53:48.436  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Merely the combination of it, at least if the nice was not sarcastic.

2/15 22:54:14.832  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: IC, but maybe would not hurt the person being licensed OC too. :D
2/15 22:54:26.828  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: I would have assumed they put some more soffisticated software on that. Sounds like an ideal thing for machinelearning.
2/15 22:54:51.995  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: I do always think I have had enough practice.
2/15 22:56:02.139  Irrissia-ArgentDawn eventually, releases the mage to sip from her tea in silence.
2/15 22:56:31.423  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I don't know. I mean the whole thing is just a dark joke more at this point. Dying hasn't been an option for while.
2/15 22:56:44.601  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Then you better hire new keeper to do everything else. :P
2/15 22:57:02.645  Arlièn-ArgentDawn drinks a little more from her tea, listening quietly to the conversations.
2/15 22:57:06.073  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/15 22:57:08.113  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: In the past, this was done by the drivers themselves. Every year at the end of the year, a groupd of drivers was tasked with making the new lines for the next year. with the proper times and such. Two weeks and it was mostly good. Then we had this »
2/15 22:57:08.113  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » bizare "We need to make HBO'ers feel important, lets deligate all the work to the HBO'ers cause they have the smartz! Peasants know no things, peasants dumb, HBO smaaaartz" and they deligated it to some idiot at a office who doesn't know how a bus »
2/15 22:57:08.113  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » looks like. Who can only look at numbers and making it as efficiant as possible. Efficiant equals insane work presure for the people who really have to work for their money. It's a big mess, and now they even took the work away from those people to »
2/15 22:57:08.113  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » have it done by chinese made cheap ass software
2/15 22:57:11.217  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn strokes her cheek lovingly before taking another sip of her wine.
2/15 22:57:11.989  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: I do have a tendancy to hoard the difficult cases
2/15 22:58:20.232  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hear that. Although suppose that topic would lead us again bit too much towards drinks to be done tonight.
2/15 22:58:25.963  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly.
2/15 22:59:00.832  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Yeah. Ever concidered finding few people that are not total nutcases? :P
2/15 22:59:20.498  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/15 22:59:25.533  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Machine learning would be great, but it shouldn't be the cheapest of the cheapest software
2/15 22:59:37.171  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Like... people that solve more headaches than cause? You know, to balance it out.
2/15 22:59:56.737  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing wrong with some drinks.
2/15 23:00:09.516  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers:  /endrant
2/15 23:00:12.628  Irrissia-ArgentDawn peers at Thalyndrae. "...Why ?"
2/15 23:00:24.187  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ...Long as there's a priestess to look after me I hear.
2/15 23:00:24.480  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: By definition, it ain't cheap to make. That shit is complex and takes a lot of knowledge to build. Actual knowledge
2/15 23:00:31.024  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: ...it's ironic, I know, but you're going to have to be more specific than that.
2/15 23:00:46.162  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: I'll stop egging you on
2/15 23:00:48.284  Irrissia-ArgentDawn taps the cheek she strokes, confused.
2/15 23:00:49.152  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, I do still have to take care of one or two things on elders list before I can pass out.
2/15 23:00:49.152  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Yeah but you know you have those fake ass programs out there
2/15 23:01:07.084  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly.
2/15 23:01:22.390  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I'm just trying to show affection?
2/15 23:01:28.910  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Or you could try to do it the other way around.
2/15 23:01:48.419  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "...S-sorry. It's... just..." She lowers her gaze to stare at her cup of tea.
2/15 23:02:22.870  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Otherway around?
2/15 23:02:23.738  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Arandell.
2/15 23:02:35.471  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I-- I can stop if you want me to?
2/15 23:02:41.415  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Have the drinks first.
2/15 23:02:46.455  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: To fool people into buying them for way too much money.
2/15 23:03:04.840  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And then see about those 'things'.
2/15 23:03:08.472  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes widely her head. "No-no-no-no-no."
2/15 23:03:08.707  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And try to report on few matters while more or less passing out?
2/15 23:03:19.564  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Mhm, and those people work at our HQ
2/15 23:03:28.986  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It might just make it more entertaining, if it weren't serious matters.
2/15 23:03:31.382  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Who can only think in "Whats the cheapest solution?"
2/15 23:03:47.900  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn smiles faintly and tries to culp Tessa's cheek in her hand, stroking it further with her thumb.
2/15 23:03:50.568  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Witnessing that sure would give me better things to worry about.
2/15 23:03:55.666  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly at Arlien.
2/15 23:04:20.600  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stays still at the beginning, a bit surprised by the second round of affection but a small smile grows on her lips.
2/15 23:04:31.068  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing too alarming so far. In fact, bit of good news even too.
2/15 23:04:46.663  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks back at Dalathria.
2/15 23:04:50.961  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good news?
2/15 23:05:16.198  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Truelly?
2/15 23:05:21.825  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sort of. Eitherway, suppose it would be different at least.
2/15 23:06:04.292  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Good, that's what I wanted to see. You look better with it anyway.
2/15 23:06:39.862  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: It also stings me alot that they declined my application to teammanager, and declined my teammanagers request to offer me a HBO Management education as they have done so in the past before (cause they were trying to get rid of my teammanager , hence »
2/15 23:06:39.862  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » they blocked his request cause they didn't want him to gather more pepole around him). Instead we get people from out side the public transport who don't understand a thing and all are here for 1 or 2 years most just to hunt promotions and move on »
2/15 23:06:39.862  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » to the next company while they couldn't even handle this. So I'm rather moody ever since. The job pays good and the work itself is nice, I'm just sitting out the time till they lose their rights to operate on these lines and we get moved to the next »
2/15 23:06:39.862  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: » company who takes over. 
2/15 23:06:41.394  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Have a feeling it might hinder my reading and writing for the rest of the night.
2/15 23:06:52.149  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ...So these supposed good news?
2/15 23:07:29.725  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Ever since that decline, and seeing they kicked my teammanager out, my fuse has become very short. It sucks, but it is as it is.
2/15 23:07:32.657  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: oof >< I can imagine that is rough
2/15 23:07:50.650  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Yeah, it was my one way to rise up
2/15 23:07:58.992  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing that great.. Simply about my meetings in Moonglade wich I mentioned to you already and seemingly perhaps some improved moods around.
2/15 23:08:06.952  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "With what...?"
2/15 23:08:16.801  Mortdorei has gone offline.
2/15 23:08:37.235  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Vashíra.
2/15 23:08:44.810  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune, Vashira.
2/15 23:08:45.687  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] GOod fortune Keeper, sisters, brother
2/15 23:08:46.594  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/15 23:08:57.343  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Vashira.
2/15 23:09:01.235  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Wouldn't that be nice?
2/15 23:09:04.993  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, Raven.
2/15 23:09:07.693  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances above her shoulders to gently bow her head at Vashira.
2/15 23:09:10.625  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hope all is well?
2/15 23:09:13.059  Dalathria-ArgentDawn looks to Vashira and inclines her head. "Evening."
2/15 23:09:35.954  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Yes buy more Vashiras. Although she is still a nutcase, just more problem solving one. :P
2/15 23:10:34.019  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Mythrandiir.
2/15 23:10:43.212  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn Inclines his head towards Arlièn in a greeting manner.
2/15 23:10:45.940  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: hehe, let me get some Gnomes to clone her
2/15 23:10:57.479  Irrissia-ArgentDawn empties her cup of tea and looks outside a moment, sidetracked.
2/15 23:11:08.322  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune to you as well, Brother. And all is well, things are relatively quiet tonight.
2/15 23:11:28.266  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: ANd i had a really good relationship with my former team manager. Ever since he foudn out my grandfather was a marine i rose insanely high on his like list xED
2/15 23:11:29.692  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: xD
2/15 23:11:48.453  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well that is good atleast *smiles*
2/15 23:12:21.789  Mortdorei has come online.
2/15 23:12:55.975  Arandell-ArgentDawn humms a bit and leans fowards to look past Tessa and Thalyndrae towards Mythrindal and dips his head.
2/15 23:13:00.615  Mortdorei has gone offline.
2/15 23:13:04.842  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Vashira, blessed eve.
2/15 23:13:07.415  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, brother. Bit curious, if I could ask a question?
2/15 23:13:21.644  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn pours himself a small cup of springwater, which he starts sipping. Returning the nod towards Arandell.
2/15 23:13:27.535  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And not about hugging plants for once.
2/15 23:13:28.984  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm? Of course.
2/15 23:13:43.486  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: That is a curious way to boost your position
2/15 23:14:00.080  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You and the commander running last night peeked my curiosity a little. As to what was the reason for it?
2/15 23:14:07.326  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Get two extra of myself as well, and you while we are at it.
2/15 23:14:12.804  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: He is a former marine himself
2/15 23:14:25.845  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We heard some commotion and the roar of a saber, so we went to investigate.
2/15 23:14:26.410  Irrissia-ArgentDawn drags Tahlyndrae out of the way, to allow Arandell and the druid to discuss.
2/15 23:14:33.045  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Oh and Gwer. When he is not talking to women. :P
2/15 23:14:46.971  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Aah, that explains a little more
2/15 23:14:52.647  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Aah, that explains a little more
2/15 23:14:54.839  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh? Was there some trouble there?
2/15 23:14:55.565  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: mt
2/15 23:15:04.589  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Seems the commander had two of her members on patrol and they encountered an old enemy along the way.
2/15 23:15:09.577  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: And my grandfather fought in the in the Dutch Indy wars as a marine, and my manager was really intested in that war. So we got to talk more then just your "hello" when passing each other.
2/15 23:15:18.739  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow.
2/15 23:15:26.063  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Some Shal'dorei filth.
2/15 23:15:54.730  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Old enemy as in... generally or more personally?
2/15 23:15:58.896  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I know very little details, we barely arrived before she made her escape.
2/15 23:16:02.147  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: That makes sense
2/15 23:16:16.125  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Fair enough. Everyone more or less unharmed?
2/15 23:16:19.444  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I suggest you ask the commander for more indepth details.
2/15 23:16:33.246  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A saber was harmed and one of them got some mana drained I believe.
2/15 23:16:46.648  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I doubt it was anything permanent.
2/15 23:17:02.548  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly, looking for Arandell. "The commander... did'nt look... in the mood for such explanations t-tonight..."
2/15 23:17:06.531  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Mana generally regenerates, it's similar to stamina.
2/15 23:17:12.262  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: And then he found out i was a movie editor before, so this year we gonna make a video for his rowing team that does charity for PTSD research and helps soldiers and police officers who suffer from PTSD.
2/15 23:17:21.226  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/15 23:17:26.653  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very true, but it depends if it was only her mana which got drained.
2/15 23:17:35.845  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You needed something from the Commander?
2/15 23:17:40.965  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: That's nice
2/15 23:17:41.465  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head at Vashira Ravenheart.
2/15 23:17:44.762  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Also true. Was she tended to?
2/15 23:17:50.269  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She said she felt "spread thin" after the encounter.
2/15 23:18:06.321  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She should be resting. I am certain her comrades are tending to her.
2/15 23:18:06.588  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: N-no, no. Just... saying she... didn't look in the mood, that... all.
2/15 23:18:16.655  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Perhaps some of her life force was drained along with mana, though I believe the Nightblades have enough Druids in their Cadre to handle that.
2/15 23:18:50.708  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Most likely. I decided not to get too involved, it seemed a sensitive topic.
2/15 23:18:56.272  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Mythrindal Rootmender.
2/15 23:19:13.445  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: A wise decision, I suppose.
2/15 23:19:29.433  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I made myself available, should they need my assistance with anything, of course.
2/15 23:19:33.844  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and drinks a little more from her tea.
2/15 23:19:46.700  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Did they leave yet?
2/15 23:19:48.402  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Will you be standing her for a bit longer?
2/15 23:19:59.518  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Or are you hosting something for Mak and Nitz?
2/15 23:20:07.371  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien and smirks briefly towards her before returning his attention towards the conversation.
2/15 23:20:10.152  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I have no knowledge of such. I barely just returned from my walk.
2/15 23:20:22.182  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Are they heading for another patrol?
2/15 23:20:23.429  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn dips her head at Mythrindal in understanding.
2/15 23:20:26.568  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: They are in the main hall...
2/15 23:20:30.666  Lyndraé nods at Irrissia.
2/15 23:20:40.586  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Possibly, given it's the Nightblades.
2/15 23:20:44.568  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: I won't be able to do it tonight anymore.
2/15 23:20:46.309  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: But I have no information.
2/15 23:20:59.237  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Duty never stops calling it seems.
2/15 23:21:03.636  Mythrandiir smiles at Lyndraé.
2/15 23:21:09.304  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: Ok, in that case, brb!
2/15 23:21:13.537  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I believe they were speaking of Anna's training... Likely resting for tonight...
2/15 23:21:16.637  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Time to have a look around
2/15 23:21:19.203  Vashíra bows before Irrissia.
2/15 23:21:24.287  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goddess watches over
2/15 23:21:25.649  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Vashira Ravenheart, politely.
2/15 23:21:27.288  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: May Aessina watches over you.
2/15 23:21:28.445  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Vashíra.
2/15 23:21:29.186  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: And we must answer.
2/15 23:22:00.399  Vashíra has gone offline.
2/15 23:22:02.229  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed. We all assist in our own way.
2/15 23:22:14.184  Nasheen has come online.
2/15 23:22:15.399  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Sup
2/15 23:22:20.486  [4. LookingForGroup] Susie-ArgentDawn: no
2/15 23:22:27.540  [4. LookingForGroup] Scarsyndrome-ArgentDawn: yes
2/15 23:22:29.643  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Indeed we do. Thalyndrae Ravenshade, by the by, pleased to make your acquaintance.
2/15 23:22:35.026  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: maybe
2/15 23:22:47.940  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mythrindal Rootmender, the pleasure is all mine.
2/15 23:23:20.699  [4. LookingForGroup] Scarsyndrome-ArgentDawn: probably
2/15 23:23:45.706  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not seeing too many arcane wielders amongst our kin anymore, so it almost feels nostalgic in a way.
2/15 23:24:02.275  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stares at the druid, confused.
2/15 23:24:18.804  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Well, there are few Highborne left and Kaldorei have only started training when the Ban was lifted.
2/15 23:24:28.477  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Compared to other elven kindred, yes, we have a lack in Arcane practitioners.
2/15 23:24:50.244  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I wonder if many are still in hiding, despite arcane being allowed once more.
2/15 23:25:12.879  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perhaps they bear a grudge for past actions..
2/15 23:25:15.246  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Many are still... distrustful, let's say.
2/15 23:25:23.513  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: They hide away in their towers and shrouded domes.
2/15 23:25:38.447  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters, bitter. "Or maybe they got badly considered by druids..."
2/15 23:25:47.529  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Understandable, I believ the distrust is mostly mutual.
2/15 23:26:02.153  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Badly considered?
2/15 23:26:52.073  Arandell-ArgentDawn leans on his elbows on the counter.
2/15 23:27:03.985  Irrissia-ArgentDawn panics when her mutters are heard and looks in her back, like a child who just said something too louf for their own good.
2/15 23:27:29.859  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn shrugs and pays it no mind.
2/15 23:27:32.886  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Tessaemay had a bad experience with certain Druids from the Circle who saw her as a half-breed instead of just a youngling wanting to learn.
2/15 23:27:39.680  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh...
2/15 23:28:07.900  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thankfully most druids tend to be willing to teach whoever has a true willingness to learn.
2/15 23:28:11.738  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and smiles to Arandell, drinking the last bit of her tea before she asks from Nantar.
2/15 23:28:24.978  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Thankfully so. Unfortunately, some are just unfortunate. 
2/15 23:28:30.614  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: But alas, our people has never been more united.
2/15 23:28:32.900  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stares back at Mythrindal, shaking her head. "No... most."
2/15 23:28:39.182  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But of course, as with all things, there are bad ones with preconceived notions about others.
2/15 23:29:24.725  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I know druids who has taught all manner of different races, regardless of their origins.
2/15 23:29:54.697  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Well, it's good to see another open-minded one right in front of me, what can I say.
2/15 23:30:12.664  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Well... I didn't meet any of them when I needed it... Was lucky enough to meet Arlien recently b-but... that's all.
2/15 23:30:25.313  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn places a hand on Tessa's shoulder.
2/15 23:30:33.691  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nasheen-ArgentDawn: The moment you realize you screwed up....cause you forgot to switch back the time line....DOOOOOH
2/15 23:30:45.850  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: :clap:
2/15 23:30:46.122  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is indeed unfortunate. I hope it did not put you off learning completely?
2/15 23:30:48.498  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Brodríck.
2/15 23:31:01.548  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn Inclines his head towards Brodríck in a greeting manner.
2/15 23:31:05.269  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nasheen-ArgentDawn: We need more locations you can switch time
2/15 23:31:06.220  Brodríck-ArgentDawn digs through a pouch on his belt.
2/15 23:31:07.114  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: oops
2/15 23:31:09.241  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I learned by myself....
2/15 23:31:36.922  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: Ishnu-alah, Son of Goldrinn.
2/15 23:31:53.013  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh? I can only applaud the willpower to take action for your own betterment. It's not easy starting down the road of the wilds without guidance.
2/15 23:31:55.332  Brodríck-ArgentDawn does a small incline back to both of the elves in a slightly rushed manner.
2/15 23:31:59.090  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales softly. "It just... hurtful to hear I was not a druidess, anymore. I-... I can't say I'm completly... over it."
2/15 23:32:15.465  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I had guidance, before... the fourth war. N-not for long. Couple of years.
2/15 23:32:25.166  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do not linger on titles. They do not define you more than the colour of your hair.
2/15 23:32:26.198  Brodríck-ArgentDawn says: A- Ah, Elune'adore.
2/15 23:32:31.497  Brodríck looks around.
2/15 23:33:01.364  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Brodric.
2/15 23:33:04.399  Irrissia-ArgentDawn rubs her hands slowly, kneading in her dress. "Maybe they don't. But... I got dismissed after the death of my Shan'do. It... was important."
2/15 23:33:29.698  Brodríck-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Arandell.
2/15 23:33:47.587  Brodríck-ArgentDawn continues digging through the pouch on his belt.

2/15 23:34:11.781  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn nods with a slightly saddened look on his face "That is a cruel judgement to make upon someone who suffered a loss, surely they were not the kind you would wish to involve yourself with regardless."
2/15 23:34:39.008  Brodríck-ArgentDawn says: *low* Say, who do I talk to about a bed for the night?
2/15 23:34:42.327  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What truly matters is your willingness to learn, your dedication to improvement and what you use your knowledge for.
2/15 23:34:58.668  Arlièn-ArgentDawn dips her head to Brodríck again, now that he has gotten a little closer.
2/15 23:35:03.022  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters almost under her breath. "Healing and protecting the balance."
2/15 23:35:36.413  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: Nantar here can help you, though it is usually Kimlya upstairs that sees to such.
2/15 23:35:39.105  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn beams a kind smile "Let the bigots fester in their own malice and focus on your own journey."
2/15 23:36:07.137  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: The Circle didn't want me. B-but... I never... stopped to learn. I stil... am. I have books, and discipline. It's just... how things are. No matter what everyone seems to pretend... Arcane is still frown upon.
2/15 23:36:09.917  Brodríck-ArgentDawn says: Ah, upstairs. Thank you kindly, miss.
2/15 23:36:14.557  Brodríck-ArgentDawn inclines his head.
2/15 23:36:15.422  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: She'll direct you to a bed on the top floor, those on the balcony are normally reserved for the injured.
2/15 23:36:20.748  Brodríck nods at you.
2/15 23:36:30.846  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If you need guidance, feel free to ask me anytime I am available.
2/15 23:36:46.305  Makhalann-ArgentDawn bows his head to the gathering, approaching with Nitzuss
2/15 23:36:53.390  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The future is for the young ones, but it's us elders who has to prepare them for it.
2/15 23:37:00.118  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks at the druid, before lowering her eyes. "I... I doubt you will approve. Or... feel comfortable guiding someone like me."
2/15 23:37:06.958  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Makhalann and Nitzuss.
2/15 23:37:17.037  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and dips her head to Makhalann and Nitzuss in greeting.
2/15 23:37:18.756  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn smiles softly at Makhalann, "Thank you, Makh."
2/15 23:37:31.085  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My offer stands, should you wish for it.
2/15 23:37:35.184  Mythrandiir smiles at Irrissia.
2/15 23:37:38.650  Nitzuss bows down graciously.
2/15 23:37:43.355  Makhalann-ArgentDawn smiles at Nitzuss "Anytime. I will go and meditate a bit now"
2/15 23:37:52.085  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Thaly needs to give her a little push if you think it fits. Tessa won't drop the Valewalker bomb by herself.
2/15 23:38:00.760  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn dips her form politely at the gathered.
2/15 23:38:22.626  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn Inclines his head towards Nitzuss in a greeting manner.
2/15 23:38:32.523  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Blessed evening sister.
2/15 23:38:37.539  Irrissia-ArgentDawn raises her gaze discretly once Mythrandiir looked away.
2/15 23:38:38.714  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Rest easy brother, goddess watch over you.
2/15 23:38:44.327  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Right..proper timeline now!
2/15 23:38:54.372  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn remembers his cup of water and starts sipping it once more.
2/15 23:39:01.871  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I need to ask. Wtf are you doing with timeline ?
2/15 23:39:08.016  Makhalann-ArgentDawn nods at Nitzuss, patting gently on her shoulders. He waves at the others, before taking his leave
2/15 23:39:13.578  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn squeezes the giant druid's arm amicably.

2/15 23:39:32.958  Nitzuss waves at Makhalann.
2/15 23:39:34.711  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: it involves timeline ?
2/15 23:39:40.322  Mythrandiir waves at Makhalann.
2/15 23:39:43.411  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Makhalann.
2/15 23:39:46.440  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nasheen-ArgentDawn: You have to switch to the proper timeline yeah
2/15 23:39:47.133  Nitzuss greets Mythrandiir warmly.
2/15 23:39:51.960  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: oooh
2/15 23:39:56.381  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: With chromie thing ?

2/15 23:40:02.725  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Mhm
2/15 23:40:03.142  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ahem found
2/15 23:40:11.511  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Forgive me. I'm a tired moron.
2/15 23:40:23.927  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien and gives a brief smile before looking more serious.
2/15 23:40:25.165  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Greetings, brother. It has, thank you. The night finds you well too, I hope?
2/15 23:40:43.502  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: afk for a bit
2/15 23:40:47.626  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: Tharandrel asked me to inform you that he and Elrinde left to Darkshore tonight.
2/15 23:40:53.671  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It has indeed, very peaceful and tranquil for once.
2/15 23:41:31.200  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn empties his cup, placing it on the counter.
2/15 23:41:36.756  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods gently, "I met them as they were about to leave. Wish them best of travels."
2/15 23:41:48.500  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: Ah, that is good to hear to see them continue their journey. I had hoped they would have taken one or two more with them though.
2/15 23:42:22.494  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah yes, Darkshore, i'll be heading there in a day or two as well.
2/15 23:42:23.496  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Vague on the details, bit omnious, about what they set out for exactly. I told them to send an owl should they require some assistance... and to stay away from bears.
2/15 23:42:26.761  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Are you a good friend of theirs?
2/15 23:42:34.209  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of whom?
2/15 23:42:44.218  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/15 23:43:13.938  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Tharandrel and Evengale.
2/15 23:43:27.508  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, I cannot say that I am.
2/15 23:43:29.937  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They do not plan it taking too long, so we are aware if they do not return in a while...
2/15 23:43:33.883  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I consider myself a good friend of all our kin, well, mostly. I cannot say I tend to form very deep bonds, as I am usually travelling alone.
2/15 23:43:47.887  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods softly, she smiles.
2/15 23:44:03.536  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: If they wish to keep their motives to themselves, I'll leave that be.
2/15 23:44:05.912  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A consequence of my duties.
2/15 23:44:10.371  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Arandell.
2/15 23:44:59.159  Irrissia-ArgentDawn grabs Thalyndrae arm, resting her head against her shoulder.
2/15 23:45:05.855  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How long do you expect to be away?
2/15 23:45:18.421  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn pets Tessa twice on her head, as her eyes drift from one conversation to the next.
2/15 23:45:28.154  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm. Did not press the matter. Unlikely he would be that open about it to me at least. But good to be aware of it.
2/15 23:45:33.254  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Depends on the state of the area. I hope to be able to survey most of it within a few days time.
2/15 23:45:49.653  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But if i find anything unusual it could take considerably longer.
2/15 23:45:52.119  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nasheen-ArgentDawn: No worries Tessa
2/15 23:46:11.786  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Its how you lvl up these day's. You select the timezone you want to quest in, so they adjust the lvls of the quests to your lvl
2/15 23:46:18.285  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn nods towards everyone gathered inside the inn before ordering herself a cup of tea.
2/15 23:46:18.587  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Also, I may have to seek guidance from the Ancients there and you know how slow those kinds of matters can be...
2/15 23:46:22.287  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Rest I will tell elsewhere. Should not require much of your time.
2/15 23:46:26.619  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "BACK IN MY DAYYYYS"... #BoomerMoment
2/15 23:46:37.723  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Tinwetar.
2/15 23:46:43.680  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn Inclines his head towards Tínwëtar in a greeting manner.
2/15 23:46:45.036  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn dips her head at Tinwetar. "Priestess."
2/15 23:46:49.831  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn snickers.
2/15 23:46:57.369  Dalathria-ArgentDawn bows her head to Tinwëtar.
2/15 23:47:07.546  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My, my, isn't that a face I haven't seen in a long time.
2/15 23:47:10.489  Irrissia-ArgentDawn releases Thaly's arm when Tinwetar enters the building, bowing her head deeply and immediatly tensing up.
2/15 23:47:14.644  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and drinks a little more from her tea. She inclines her head to Tinwetar and smiles brightly to Nasheen.
2/15 23:47:24.584  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nephal'anar an dieb, commander. I hope the day has found you well?
2/15 23:47:27.980  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn sneaks her hand behind Tessa and tries stroking her gently, trying to soothe her.
2/15 23:47:30.853  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: Ishnu-alah, Priestess, and to you as well, Nasheen.
2/15 23:47:37.382  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Elune be with you.
2/15 23:47:39.301  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Nasheen.
2/15 23:47:46.487  Nasheen-ArgentDawn inclines her head respectfully.
2/15 23:47:47.485  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn inclines her head politely at Tinwetar.
2/15 23:48:10.522  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Blessed evening, Rootmender. Sisters. And it is well enough, thank you. Tired of meetings. How are you?
2/15 23:48:18.236  Nasheen-ArgentDawn inclines her head to the others.
2/15 23:48:27.222  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It's been a long time, how have you been Arlien?
2/15 23:48:35.830  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Almost finished my preparations for my departure tomorrow.
2/15 23:48:53.387  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh? Looking forward to heading out?
2/15 23:48:55.221  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Now I just need a few hours of rest and I will be fully ready.
2/15 23:49:07.991  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters under her breath, just for Thalyndrae to hear.
2/15 23:49:09.884  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm... It's not so much looking forward to as it is a necessity.
2/15 23:49:11.276  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah. Rest is important, indeed.
2/15 23:49:22.013  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: I have found myself increasingly busy again over the past months. It would have been far worse were it not for the assistance of your Thero'shan.
2/15 23:49:35.707  Lyndraé nods at Irrissia.
2/15 23:49:36.009  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I dread to find Darkshore in a worse state than last I surveyed it.
2/15 23:49:57.282  Nasheen-ArgentDawn smiles gently "I was glad to hear she found herself useful under your care"
2/15 23:50:02.707  Irrissia-ArgentDawn doesn't manage to take her eyes away from Tinwetar, clearly stressed up, she needs a moment to follow Thalyndrae.
2/15 23:50:09.096  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So I will ask Elune for her luck, that things may have improved instead.
2/15 23:50:11.428  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I pray you will find it improved, brother. How long do you expect to be gone?
2/15 23:50:24.008  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A couple of days, if nothing unusual is found.
2/15 23:50:30.978  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: She's not going to eat you, you know?
2/15 23:50:37.145  Irrissia-ArgentDawn sighs deeply, before sitting on the railling.
2/15 23:50:41.338  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Certainly so. I think she has also blossomed and learned a great deal.
2/15 23:50:51.645  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is a simple survey, so hopefully it will be a somewhat swift matter.
2/15 23:51:16.067  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: That response does not look to great in SF
2/15 23:51:17.094  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] With a hint of insanity.
2/15 23:51:26.691  Irrissia-ArgentDawn grabs her knees around herself. "I know..."
2/15 23:51:32.054  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is good to hear, she has potentional. *Looks at Arandell* Pardon?
2/15 23:51:35.283  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What do you expect, these nights?
2/15 23:51:36.895  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed. Let us hope the Goddess and the Wild Gods give you a few favourable days during your survey then.
2/15 23:51:42.481  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums to Arandell.
2/15 23:51:43.759  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Nope. I was expecting bit better. But we will see, its not the first time it doesn't look great.
2/15 23:51:50.205  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn sips her tea, her shoulders slumping just a little.
2/15 23:51:58.189  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing.
2/15 23:52:00.401  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If nothing else, it will keep me active.
2/15 23:52:04.552  Mythrandiir chuckles at Tínwëtar.
2/15 23:52:13.434  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles.
2/15 23:52:19.243  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] At least it's prefered to endless meetings and politics.
2/15 23:52:25.295  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: You need to get used to attention. Arlien counts on you, Tinwetar seemingly does so as well.
2/15 23:52:50.263  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah, you must be the famed Arandell I heard about then.
2/15 23:52:53.917  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes. I can certainly see the appeal. There is a reason I have served with the Sentinels since their founding and not within a Temple all this time.
2/15 23:53:06.734  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears. "She doesn't... And Arlien... could get helped by anyone..."
2/15 23:53:15.402  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow.
2/15 23:53:19.392  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Point stands, Tessa.
2/15 23:53:19.782  Nifre has gone offline.
2/15 23:53:26.217  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That does not sound good.
2/15 23:53:29.564  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I can imagine ceremonies and and such can get a bit dull as well, given enough time.
2/15 23:54:11.458  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not all from the temple is meant to perform clergical duties... I believe your own high priestess would be a prime example of that.
2/15 23:54:16.786  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh, I still enjoy ceremonies. Quite a bit actually. But it is more theatre than anything else. Not quite the same thing.
2/15 23:54:20.319  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do you not recall him? He has been around Ashenvale for the past decade, I am fairly sure you must have met before.
2/15 23:54:30.306  Mythrandiir nods at Tínwëtar.
2/15 23:55:00.108  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Thalyndrae. "In what ?"
2/15 23:55:02.155  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hm yes, he does look familiar. But it's been a long time since I was here last.
2/15 23:55:18.903  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Two decades. In passing we have. Remember hearing some rumors too back then...
2/15 23:55:22.119  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Thodim-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/15 23:55:28.962  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: You are growing, your power and knowledge are growing, your usefulness to many are growing. But you seem more and more scared to actually help or be noticed.
2/15 23:55:29.257  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Rumors?
2/15 23:55:32.471  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly.
2/15 23:55:36.793  Iâlluen has gone offline.
2/15 23:55:48.407  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But yes, not all of us are born politicians or diplomats. Some of us are born for a different kind of service.
2/15 23:55:51.007  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I can not quite recall details. Likely you were not rumored to be a dragon at least then.
2/15 23:56:00.806  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles faintly. "Can we just... speak about something else ?"
2/15 23:56:09.773  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: We can speak about anything you wish.
2/15 23:56:17.136  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That would have been a interesting rumor. I fear I'm nothing special to have rumors about.
2/15 23:56:26.073  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thankfully, there are many outside of the temple that need the guidance you and your sisterhood provides.
2/15 23:56:53.669  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not to mention healing and restorative measures.
2/15 23:57:01.602  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: What.... about your night ? What did you do, before joining us ?
2/15 23:57:08.969  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed, that is true. And I feel it is a bit more fulfilling to be able to help a bit more...directly...I suppose.
2/15 23:57:10.995  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would that not be interesting, if we all were?
2/15 23:57:15.190  You smirk slyly at Arandell.
2/15 23:57:15.866  Irrissia-ArgentDawn rests her head on her knees, glancing at Thalyndrae sideway.
2/15 23:57:29.864  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It certainly is nice when you can see the results of your efforts take effect directly.
2/15 23:57:37.527  Nasheen-ArgentDawn looks around the bar for a moment.
2/15 23:57:39.738  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I took a long, much needed bath, as I read and utterly consumed a bottle of wine. The usual.
2/15 23:57:42.534  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn inclines her head. "Evening, sisters, brothers."
2/15 23:57:47.123  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would make for some awkward moments of revelations at somepoint.
2/15 23:58:03.581  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Alyssrea from across the bar.
2/15 23:58:11.721  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn nods in agreement with Mythrindal before turning to nod in greeting towards Alyssrea.
2/15 23:58:14.066  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ishnu'alah sister. Hope you are well on this fine evening.
2/15 23:58:17.029  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn Inclines his head towards Alyssrea in a greeting manner.
2/15 23:58:18.560  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sister. Blessed evening.
2/15 23:58:37.159  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So tell me old friend, what is left of the Hermitage? With all that has been going on the last decade, I kind of lost contact with the others. I heard from Raven that there no longer is a Sentinel Cadre in the Hermitage? Is that true?
2/15 23:58:58.296  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am fine, thank you, brother. 
2/15 23:59:01.181  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening sister.
2/15 23:59:26.847  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How have you all been holding up? It has been a while again.
2/15 23:59:35.793  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "Most left to join the fighting and from many we have not heard since. We are left with only a few protectors."
2/15 23:59:49.385  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn steps a little closer towards the bar and orders herself a refreshing glass of water.
2/16 00:00:26.571  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am personally holding up just fine. Simply resting before departing again, so I have no need to complain.
2/16 00:00:54.798  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn sips her tea. "I am well enough, thank you, sister. How are you?"
2/16 00:00:56.786  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A path many of us followed yes. 
2/16 00:01:15.116  Arlièn-ArgentDawn lowers her head in grieving for a moment.
2/16 00:01:33.164  Nasheen-ArgentDawn has a slight hint of lost in her eyes before snapping back again.
2/16 00:02:34.192  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: That's why the bottle was gone...
2/16 00:02:45.177  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I need to restock wine...
2/16 00:02:47.389  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Just passing across the town? I don't think we have met before. *she looks towards Tinwetar* Doing fine as well, revered Priestess. Could use some Horde as target practise though.
2/16 00:03:03.347  Thylendra has gone offline.
2/16 00:03:03.347  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I was here a few weeks ago as well. I did not reckonize anyone anymore, tho I did meet a few of the Hermitage.
2/16 00:03:35.415  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of course, my manners. Mythrindal Rootmender, a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
2/16 00:03:41.587  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I heard. There are some still back at the Hermitage, but they rarely venture out.
2/16 00:03:51.552  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: ...apologies, it seemed to call out to me.
2/16 00:03:53.128  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I had to answer.
2/16 00:04:01.133  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn gives Alyssrea a faint smile and a nod. "I know a few others who could use the same, sister. So far they have kept away from our settlements, but you never know."
2/16 00:04:01.932  Arlièn-ArgentDawn gestures to Arandell at the moment she mentioned 'heard'.
2/16 00:04:05.872  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You did well... I don't drink anymore.
2/16 00:04:18.345  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Even if we had met before, I doubt I could remember. My ability to remember people was never very good.
2/16 00:04:18.778  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Pleasure, brother Rootmender. Alyssrea Whispershot, a sentinel. Although currently without a cadre to run with.
2/16 00:04:24.280  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks at Arlien.
2/16 00:04:26.610  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Why?
2/16 00:04:34.244  Alyssrea laughs at Mythrandiir.
2/16 00:04:35.477  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What have I told you about sources, elder?
2/16 00:04:45.244  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Cloud the mind... I don't... need that.
2/16 00:04:50.245  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You aren't the only druid saying that, brother. 
2/16 00:05:00.273  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A pleasure, seems Astranaar is full of sentinels these days, which is always a welcome sight.
2/16 00:05:15.179  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Ah, that's why you have been so on edge lately.
2/16 00:05:20.876  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Imagine the confusion when two druids attempt to remember each other then.
2/16 00:05:25.215  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Such compliments, brother. You will have the entire cadre blushing, mark my words.
2/16 00:05:27.169  Tínwëtar smirks slyly at Mythrandiir.
2/16 00:05:28.263  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Because I don't drink ?
2/16 00:05:30.517  Irrissia peers at Lyndraé searchingly.
2/16 00:05:30.859  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If there is no cadre anymore in the Hermitage, then I guess I have to find myself a new place? 
2/16 00:05:32.991  Lyndraé nods at Irrissia.
2/16 00:05:34.233  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Yes.
2/16 00:05:42.950  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Drinking makes it worst, Thalyndrae...
2/16 00:05:56.549  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I was always the charmer, there's not a tree I couldn't woo with a few words.
2/16 00:06:01.737  Mythrandiir grins wickedly at Tínwëtar.
2/16 00:06:07.141  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'd be imagining two druids just greeting each other over and over again, as if they never met before. More confusing to bystanders.
2/16 00:06:18.989  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I find it relaxing.
2/16 00:06:29.392  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn gives Mythrindal a long look, eyebrows arched. "That escalated quickly."
2/16 00:06:37.692  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That would be quite the sight, but let's hope that's not the case for the majority of my brothers.
2/16 00:06:54.834  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Or we'd never get anything done.
2/16 00:07:24.271  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It was...
2/16 00:07:27.915  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It would be detrimental, that we agree on. Although witnessing a situation like that could be entertaining, once or twice at least.
2/16 00:07:28.830  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think Vashira would welcome your help, and you could try to re-establish the branch.
2/16 00:07:40.250  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Although I have witnessed a couple of pandaren who continuously bowed for several hours, in an argument of who should be the last one to do so.
2/16 00:07:47.942  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Alcohol is the only way to cope with some of the failings of this world.
2/16 00:07:49.282  Lyndraé shrugs. Who knows?
2/16 00:08:07.395  Alyssrea raises her eyebrow inquisitively at Mythrandiir.
2/16 00:08:08.531  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "What about affection instead...?"
2/16 00:08:19.650  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Truly, brother?
2/16 00:08:32.301  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But truth be told, we are few in numbers and your skills may be better served with the Nightblades, if they deem it fitting.
2/16 00:08:39.741  Uodrieth has gone offline.
2/16 00:08:39.972  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That sounds extremely counterproductive. Why? Only to be polite?
2/16 00:08:39.972  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed, they seem even more stubborn in their beliefs and customs than even our kin.
2/16 00:08:59.295  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think it was a matter of... honour in some strange way?
2/16 00:09:00.301  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would be like herding sabers at the moment.
2/16 00:09:10.398  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Or misunderstood politeness.
2/16 00:09:19.652  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Affection always has a way of coming back to stab you in the back.
2/16 00:09:21.521  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Regardless, it was.. quite ridiculous to behold.
2/16 00:09:37.324  Nasheen-ArgentDawn nods a little at both in understanding "I suppose it depends on what you want with the Hermitage Arlien. What path you have in mind for it"
2/16 00:09:40.938  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I can well imagine that. Goddess above. They would get nothing done, indeed.
2/16 00:10:19.332  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn cracks into a short, amused laugh as she pictures it. "...Do tell they weren't sober at least."
2/16 00:10:35.840  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Truth be told I can never tell if a pandaren is sober to begin with.
2/16 00:10:54.631  Irrissia-ArgentDawn ears drops and she curls up on herself tighter.
2/16 00:11:09.146  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So they may have been, or perhaps not.
2/16 00:11:10.151  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I didn't mean ours, but you've experienced it plenty, you know it.
2/16 00:11:14.218  Mythrandiir shrugs at Alyssrea. Who knows?
2/16 00:11:16.625  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is tricky, I agree. They tend to be pretty jovial no matter if they are sober or drunk. They are perhaps a bit...slower...when they are drunk.
2/16 00:11:36.064  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My priority is to rebuild and reestablish ourselves. But that means we need to protect what we have.
2/16 00:11:44.034  Irrissia-ArgentDawn doesn't answer, caught in bad chain of memories, her eyes staring at the void.
2/16 00:11:46.863  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed, though some seem to gain haste from alcohol as well.
2/16 00:11:50.864  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn thinks Myth's words for a bit and ends up shrugging as well. The sentinel didn't know better either.
2/16 00:11:58.061  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I presonally do not have the time to rebuild the cadre though.
2/16 00:12:02.551  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn blinks next to Tessa and tries to embrace her.
2/16 00:12:15.817  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I truly have no idea how the pandaren body functions. Seems like alcohol may as well just be fuel.
2/16 00:12:28.850  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shivers, her focus breaking, slightly in panic. She wraps her arms around Thalyndrae, hidding in her dress.
2/16 00:12:33.186  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Raven wrote with full pride about her assigned task, I would not take that from her.
2/16 00:12:36.783  Nasheen-ArgentDawn shakes her head.
2/16 00:12:57.416  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn huffs disapprovingly. "It destroys your liver."
2/16 00:13:05.716  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: We'll be fine.
2/16 00:13:08.783  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The pandaren work in mysterious ways, indeed.
2/16 00:13:21.379  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn nods in agreement with Alyssrea.
2/16 00:13:33.182  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/16 00:13:38.987  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What do you wish, then?
2/16 00:13:47.775  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Everything in moderation.
2/16 00:14:06.376  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I don't indulge in alcohol.... or anything really, but sometimes it can be a pleasant experience.
2/16 00:14:30.354  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Never? How come?
2/16 00:15:00.267  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods firmly. "Our culture encourages better use of it than how you were making the pandaren sound. But I have hardly met any aside from walking past a few."
2/16 00:15:04.076  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not much alcohol to be found when you are wandering the wilds. Except for fermenting fruits, but those are usually too harsh.
2/16 00:15:45.292  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I honestly do not know. I been a Sentinel for a long time, it is who and what I am. But I also been without our Cadre for a long time, mostly serving the main branch where ever needed. Till recently I had no time to think of what I want and where I »
2/16 00:15:46.024  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » would go, I just moved from Conflict to Conflict, from assignement to assignement.
2/16 00:15:54.241  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I believe the pandaren body may work in such a way that it simply cleanses the alcohol from their bodies within a short timespan, hence none of the bad side effects appear.
2/16 00:15:55.338  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Fair enough. I keep forgetting that you do not frequent settlements that often, brother. My apologies.
2/16 00:16:08.297  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That's purely speculative from my side, however.
2/16 00:16:11.982  |Kq21|k whispers: Psst
2/16 00:16:19.125  To |Kq21|k: hmm?
2/16 00:16:19.342  |Kq21|k whispers: Need the dates for the timeskiiip
2/16 00:16:28.313  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do not mind it, not many choose to live as I do.
2/16 00:16:37.210  |Kq21|k whispers: Still waiting for the planning campaign :p
2/16 00:16:53.436  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn ponders his words again and hums. "Like a coin without its flipside..."
2/16 00:17:13.503  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Besides, it's also my own fault for not simply bringing some alcohol along when I visit civilised areas.
2/16 00:17:20.368  Mythrandiir smiles at Tínwëtar.
2/16 00:17:25.582  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn hums a soft tune about the moonrise and the night.
2/16 00:17:46.582  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will ask a pandaren scholar about the topic some day, see if anything I said makes sense.
2/16 00:18:02.309  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Nasheen: "That I understand. You know you can find rest and time to reflect at the Hermitage."
2/16 00:18:11.378  To |Kq21|k: hehe, fair point.
2/16 00:18:11.610  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No. I suppose not. It is a different kind of experience, certainly. With plenty of benefits, I am sure. But...I cannot help but wonder if you ever miss the connection with kin out there? Forgive me if that is too intrusive a question. Curiosity, you »
2/16 00:18:12.733  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » understand.
2/16 00:18:23.710  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn sips the last of her tea and hands Nantar her cup with a silent thanks.
2/16 00:18:39.179  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Are you sure...?"
2/16 00:18:45.442  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think I will settle back here for a while atleast. Figure out where to go from here *She nods alittle*
2/16 00:18:56.576  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: It is, honestly, the only thing I'm sure about at the moment. Everything else is clouded for me.
2/16 00:18:58.546  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm going for a walk to the hermitage, have a blessed evening everyone.
2/16 00:18:59.194  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: But... we'll be fine.
2/16 00:19:02.289  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I'll make sure of it.
2/16 00:19:16.757  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Nitzuss.
2/16 00:19:17.873  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn dips into a bow politely.
2/16 00:19:22.967  Irrissia-ArgentDawn smiles gently, planting a soft kiss on Thaly's cheek.
2/16 00:19:23.217  Nitzuss smiles at you.
2/16 00:19:27.706  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods once, her attention drawn towards the conversation between Myth and Tin, she remains silent.
2/16 00:19:29.473  Nasheen-ArgentDawn bows her head to Nitzuss "May your troubles be diminished"
2/16 00:19:30.838  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] From time to time, hence why I visit places like Astranaar.
2/16 00:19:35.844  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Nitzuss.
2/16 00:19:37.278  To |Kq21|k: Did you talk with Thaly about it yet?
2/16 00:19:41.230  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles faintly. "Thanks... I-I... needed to hear it."
2/16 00:19:42.853  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goddess' grace.
2/16 00:19:46.825  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May our troubles be diminished, Nitzuss.
2/16 00:19:49.310  |Kq21|k whispers: He doesn't know, hence why...
2/16 00:19:50.049  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May Her light guide.
2/16 00:19:53.141  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I... kind of needed to hear it as well.
2/16 00:20:00.458  Nitzuss bows down graciously.
2/16 00:20:02.851  |Kq21|k whispers: Better give him dates, and lock down the nights.
2/16 00:20:06.837  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But, I have always been a firm believer that duty comes first, regardless of my own personal needs and opinions on the matter.
2/16 00:20:12.998  Nitzuss bows down graciously.
2/16 00:20:14.770  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Then, we will be alright.
2/16 00:20:18.251  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn inclines her head slightly towards Nitzuss.
2/16 00:20:25.581  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, at least something else than more druids...
2/16 00:20:27.306  To |Kq21|k: How much can I tell him/how do we make sure he is there for the second event?
2/16 00:20:27.755  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sisters, brother. Elune guide you.
2/16 00:20:28.008  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Elune's grace, sister.
2/16 00:20:34.691  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nature's blessing, sister.
2/16 00:20:41.207  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May her Light guide, sister.
2/16 00:20:44.593  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah yes, I heard about that.
2/16 00:20:45.321  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn turns her attention back towards Mythrindal.
2/16 00:21:00.176  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/16 00:21:01.642  Lyndraé nods.
2/16 00:21:04.510  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, I can certainly understand that sentiment, considering I have lived by that creed all my life myself.
2/16 00:21:14.821  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Albeit in a different kind of service.
2/16 00:21:24.626  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm still a bit confused, do we not all work together anymore these day's? 
2/16 00:22:27.492  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But yes, even I can wish for the company of kin at times. The woodlands creatures and spirits of nature is all well and good, but they hardly replace ones own family.
2/16 00:22:48.691  |Kq21|k whispers: If we give dates now, he can lock them and be sure to not do anything else on those nights.
2/16 00:23:05.055  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Do you want to stay here more?
2/16 00:23:10.743  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We try, but past events have driven a wedge that we seek to overcome.
2/16 00:23:16.433  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Here... ?
2/16 00:23:17.137  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn nods thoughtfully, sipping her tea.
2/16 00:23:20.859  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Astranaar. 
2/16 00:23:34.159  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: O-oh... No. It's... I feel better now. Thanks.
2/16 00:23:42.827  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thankfully, it is never too difficult to visit the various settlements.
2/16 00:23:49.693  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think that kind of desire keeps us all balanced. Whether we are team players or lone wanderers.
2/16 00:23:50.325  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I'd go back.
2/16 00:23:50.325  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: B-but... would like you to stay one more night at the Hermitage, if you... you agree ?
2/16 00:23:53.124  Lyndraé nods at Irrissia.
2/16 00:23:56.092  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: It's what I was going to suggest.
2/16 00:24:01.924  Irrissia-ArgentDawn smiles slightly.
2/16 00:24:07.459  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I can stay here as long as you and Arlien allow me.
2/16 00:24:17.905  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, I suppose they do not. Family, friends and kin are important. -Community- is important. It is why we serve, at the end of the day.
2/16 00:24:22.753  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I slept better, knowing...
2/16 00:24:23.029  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed, even the grumpiest of hermit sometimes misses the embrace of his mother.
2/16 00:24:27.955  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn nods in agreement with Alyssrea's words as well.
2/16 00:24:31.386  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stops her sentence, her ears lowering slightly.
2/16 00:24:32.392  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What has happened here? Back then there were many of us, druids, sentinels, priests, artists, every kin out there working together to prospor Ashenvale.
2/16 00:25:02.501  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Of course. I'll stay then.
2/16 00:25:07.476  |Kq21|k whispers: So just pick whatever date you like. For me, tuesday/thursday night aren't the best, but I can be here. 25th is a big no-no
2/16 00:25:19.977  Mythrandiir-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Which is also why I visit a somewhat regular intervals. It's a good reminder of why I take my duty seriously, after all.
2/16 00:25:22.392  |Kq21|k whispers: And I have council on the 27th BUT i can move it.
2/16 00:25:26.593  To |Kq21|k: check, i'll keep that in mind
2/16 00:25:38.564  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods firmly. 
2/16 00:25:43.415  |Kq21|k whispers: (Or if it's during timeloss, I don't care if the in-between event take place here, as I don't have to be here.)
2/16 00:26:37.026  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The War happened and it drove up the tensions that always existed to a lesser extend. Where to place our priority and how to go about it in missions.

2/16 00:27:08.753  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn nods as well, looking thoughtful again.
2/16 00:27:25.303  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I believe that Vashira is actually making a difference in that, taking a more militaristic approach to her missions.
2/16 00:27:31.410  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed, it is.
2/16 00:27:33.343  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Thanks."
2/16 00:27:55.756  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks outside for a moment.
2/16 00:27:58.080  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm. Working together instead pickering how things should be done.
2/16 00:28:14.851  Nasheen-ArgentDawn looks proud for a moment
2/16 00:28:27.919  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But how about you, sister? Do you tend to put duty before yourself and your own wishes and needs? It is not necessarily a good thing to always do that, hence why I ask.

2/16 00:29:22.643  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good to hear that. It is a proofen concept that works. You need order in Chaos, you need a chain of command for having to many commanders leaves you without guidance and structure.
2/16 00:29:29.931  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Shall we, then?
2/16 00:29:40.948  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Confusion and room to question.
2/16 00:29:46.014  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I will join you in a minute... I want to say goodnight to Arlien and Arandell.
2/16 00:29:49.885  Lyndraé nods at Irrissia.
2/16 00:29:53.561  Irrissia-ArgentDawn slides from the railling.
2/16 00:29:53.865  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I'll join you.
2/16 00:29:59.003  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Do you need to leave too, or do you want to stay a while longer?
2/16 00:30:03.330  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Duty to my kin means most to me. But I have met sisters in arms who lose themselves into that sense of duty... I'm trying to keep in touch with mine, if that makes sense?
2/16 00:30:24.091  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Think I could run off as well.
2/16 00:30:25.588  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head softly, remaining silent to not interrupt the discussion.
2/16 00:30:30.559  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes. Perfectly, and I admire you for that, sister. It is a hard balance to maintain.
2/16 00:30:37.011  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You don't get things done if you keep questioning everything.
2/16 00:30:47.847  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and bows her head to Tessaemay and Thalyndrae: "You are taking your leave?"
2/16 00:31:01.067  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "Unless you need something...?"
2/16 00:31:06.688  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well... would perhaps disagree to an extent, but time and place for such.
2/16 00:31:14.426  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I agree. You may know what is the best, or ideal balance for you. But that doesn't always play out in reality. As much as you try...
2/16 00:31:31.179  Nirandae has come online.
2/16 00:32:19.343  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn nods in agreement, a wry, slightly self-depricating smile curving her lips upward just a little.
2/16 00:32:42.097  Nasheen-ArgentDawn nods a little.
2/16 00:32:45.982  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, not at all, I was just thinking of leaving as well though before I do I would like to hear what Arandell had to say.
2/16 00:33:42.580  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very true. It is something worth striving for though, if one is able to do so. Maintaining balance...is that not our sacred charge?
2/16 00:34:10.143  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: We can wait a minute, if you want ?
2/16 00:34:36.503  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods firmly in agreement. Her curiosity softens her expression a little.
2/16 00:34:38.909  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What about you, priestess? I think you have plenty of experience to share in that regard. If I may pry, of course.
2/16 00:35:16.580  Arlièn-ArgentDawn shakes her head with a smile: "Don't worry over it. Go on, we will join you later on."
2/16 00:35:40.973  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn had just taken a sip of tea and almost chokes on it as she lets out a short and sharp laugh.
2/16 00:35:48.639  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Selgrynn-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/16 00:35:55.307  Mythrandiir raises his eyebrow inquisitively at Tínwëtar.
2/16 00:36:06.423  Irrissia-ArgentDawn gently shakes her head. "You made me curious..."
2/16 00:36:45.167  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh, Goddess...what gave you that impression? No. I am afraid my experience does not lie in being able to maintain a healthy balance between duty and my own needs.
2/16 00:36:46.256  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn presses her lips together to control the smile which started curling on her lips.
2/16 00:37:17.894  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As am I, but Arandell asked for privacy.
2/16 00:37:30.906  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not for everyone's ears.
2/16 00:37:45.171  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: a
2/16 00:37:51.739  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I live to serve, and that is all.
2/16 00:37:52.839  Arandell-ArgentDawn mainly looks at Thalyndrae as he spoke.
2/16 00:37:52.839  [4. LookingForGroup] Susie-ArgentDawn: b
2/16 00:38:03.255  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Sorry.
2/16 00:38:12.025  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn coughs again, before taking another sip of tea. This time she does not die, thankfully.
2/16 00:38:13.076  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears.
2/16 00:38:15.690  Nasheen-ArgentDawn glances at Tinwëtar for a moment, overhearing the converstaion.
2/16 00:38:23.989  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Yes, yes, I understand. 
2/16 00:38:41.473  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You are the commander of a very esteemed cadre of sentinels. You set the example to many.
2/16 00:39:04.326  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn inclines her head slightly at the praise.
2/16 00:39:11.793  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing Tessa can not hear on the other hand.
2/16 00:39:25.093  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I'll be outside then.
2/16 00:39:26.125  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks at the ground, thorn appart.
2/16 00:39:29.261  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thank you. I actively encourage them to not follow my example, naturally. I am not always successful, mind you.
2/16 00:39:29.859  Lyndraé gently pats Irrissia.
2/16 00:39:33.260  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not perhaps much of an interest either, but...
2/16 00:39:37.493  Arandell-ArgentDawn shrugs.
2/16 00:39:37.727  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Arandell is so nice to put Tessa in such position xD
2/16 00:40:06.400  Alyssrea laughs at Tínwëtar.
2/16 00:40:15.035  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Arandell.
2/16 00:40:15.281  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: nah dw
2/16 00:40:17.291  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Highborne and all that
2/16 00:40:17.772  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: I get it
2/16 00:40:18.715  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Shall we step towards the lake then?
2/16 00:40:37.968  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do they follow your words or your examples, more often than not?
2/16 00:40:40.075  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We, or at least I, will be taking my leave afterwards.
2/16 00:41:31.849  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly, silent.
2/16 00:41:32.531  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Unless you wish to join as well Nasheen, I hope to see you again another night.
2/16 00:41:47.768  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and inclines her head to Nasheen.
2/16 00:41:54.862  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It was good to hear your voice again.
2/16 00:41:55.680  [4. LookingForGroup] Scarsyndrome-ArgentDawn: c
2/16 00:41:59.627  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It depends on who we are talking about. The Priestesses are worse than the others. Most of the others are fine in that respect, now that I think about it.
2/16 00:42:05.427  Nasheen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will be around a bit more, you can count on that *gives a gentle smile* May your troubles be diminished"
2/16 00:42:19.474  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Nasheen.
2/16 00:42:25.437  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Nasheen Wintersong, politely.
2/16 00:42:32.415  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May Her light guide.
2/16 00:42:36.889  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Nasheen and Dalathria, as well as the others on the other side of the bar.
2/16 00:42:42.493  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May our troubles be diminished.
2/16 00:42:47.921  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: May Aessina protects you.
2/16 00:42:53.824  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Good night!
2/16 00:43:01.346  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well and not part of hermitage.... and yes, highborne. G*night!
2/16 00:43:21.687  Irrissia-ArgentDawn follows by automatism.
2/16 00:43:21.687  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: G'night o/
2/16 00:43:53.680  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] First of all, the small good news. Makhalann seemed much happier. Nitzuss seemed to improve his mood.
2/16 00:44:04.720  Lyndraé has gone offline.
2/16 00:44:15.229  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is good to hear, I thought as much.
2/16 00:44:17.916  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stands in a corner, joining her hands.
2/16 00:44:41.969  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Dalathria seems more or less good as well. Or as usually.
2/16 00:45:41.058  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/16 00:45:44.519  Annaeya has gone offline.
2/16 00:45:48.251  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Now, I was going to talk bit about why Tessa was called to Nightblades, but seems the brother was quite open about it. Only thing to add is that Ialluen was the one... uh. Affected.
2/16 00:45:59.216  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arandell Moonsong.
2/16 00:46:26.502  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles, stressed. "Thyreena wanted to have someone to look at her, but... finally, I was just... asked lots of things with vague questions and that's all."
2/16 00:46:40.037  Arlièn-ArgentDawn looks over her shoulder towards the nightblades on the balcony of the hall.
2/16 00:46:40.402  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods at Tessa.
2/16 00:46:41.697  Nirandae has gone offline.
2/16 00:46:56.592  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They do not like to share much.
2/16 00:47:13.944  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: B-but I think... We should leave them alone, as long as they don't ask for help. They dismised a curious mage quite...
2/16 00:47:19.676  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: ...firmly.
2/16 00:47:51.990  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Agreed. We help, if it is asked. Better not be too nosy.
2/16 00:48:03.302  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arandell Moonsong.
2/16 00:48:07.304  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.

2/16 00:49:24.065  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As long as it won't pose an immediate threat to us, I can respect that.
2/16 00:49:33.066  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It won't.
2/16 00:49:38.196  Nasheen has gone offline.
2/16 00:49:38.464  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... Yes, some of them not too keen on people talking. We trust them well enough to not worry what they know and to let us know, if we need to know.
2/16 00:49:40.958  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: They seemed perfectly sure of that.
2/16 00:50:00.869  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods once more.
2/16 00:51:15.289  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Then lastly, unfortunately, I had few meetings and letters during last week.
2/16 00:51:25.687  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Arandell.
2/16 00:53:13.126  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I should have few pair of ears listening now. Remains to be seen if they fill my ears with lies, useless things or maybe something useful.
2/16 00:53:50.960  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "I hear you."
2/16 00:54:25.234  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It also means I will be doing so in return.
2/16 00:54:49.631  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of course. If we can assist, let me know.
2/16 00:55:49.303  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] For now I will simply choose carefully what to share. Means I will be keeping few secrets too. Not fond of it, but so it will go.
2/16 00:56:02.400  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances at Tessa for a moment.
2/16 00:56:20.962  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "From... me ? or from Thalyndrae ?"
2/16 00:56:21.244  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "So it will be. I trust you."
2/16 00:57:59.751  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Likely at times from everyone, Tessa.
2/16 00:59:13.956  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But not matters that concern or relate to you.
2/16 00:59:20.534  Thyreena has come online.
2/16 00:59:27.095  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly, asking another question. "Should I keep everything from the Hermitage away from her ? Other than that thing."
2/16 01:00:04.913  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Up to Arlien to decide. I do not trust her, but that hardly a suprise to anyone.
2/16 01:00:43.086  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/16 01:01:10.064  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters in a very blunt way. "I understand why you don't."
2/16 01:01:36.255  Thyreena has gone offline.
2/16 01:01:51.334  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We have few secrets. Well, compared to most others.
2/16 01:02:42.991  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Just... said what you want. *She joins her hands* I won't... be problematic. I understand why it's better to... keep her away for now. That's why... I asked you if she could stay.
2/16 01:03:40.119  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But it is also true. Most of the matters of the hermitage are such that could be shouted from the rooftops. Only more personal matters more discreet.
2/16 01:03:53.835  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arandell Moonsong.
2/16 01:04:24.108  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed.
2/16 01:04:32.888  [1. General] Stormdággér-ArgentDawn: Yo yo rp peeps, is there any rp I can join in n? I dont wanna barge into something thats kinda private :)
2/16 01:04:37.598  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Wich is a rather welcome change to things.
2/16 01:04:41.220  Arlièn-ArgentDawn nods in agreement with Arandell.
2/16 01:04:42.324  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles and nods.
2/16 01:05:02.740  [1. General] Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: RP in the inn is open as always
2/16 01:05:06.832  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters with a relieved smile. "Yes, it is..."
2/16 01:05:08.034  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But we should head back now. I am already running late.
2/16 01:05:17.414  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Late for bed
2/16 01:05:39.309  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Yes, yes... Just one thing. I recieved an invitation for another Starlight Meeting.
2/16 01:05:47.659  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes. I will require a some quick way to visit old town, but that is for later date.
2/16 01:05:54.533  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: So... Tomorrow, I have one to attend. To see where the project take place.
2/16 01:06:14.741  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You can ask Thalyndrae. -Or- I can ask her for you. To make you a portal.
2/16 01:06:30.103  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/16 01:06:34.110  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Arandell.
2/16 01:06:41.137  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When I know when.
2/16 01:06:46.447  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly.
2/16 01:06:52.399  [1. General] Stormdággér-ArgentDawn: Ayy nice 
2/16 01:06:55.019  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Likely postponing it after the campaign anyways.
2/16 01:07:00.028  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yes. I remember saying "midniiight"
2/16 01:07:06.753  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Good.
2/16 01:07:14.459  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Easier to see it coming that way.
2/16 01:07:22.614  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let me know what was discussed, I am curious.
2/16 01:07:31.811  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Usually even if busy, Alan is okey for Thaly to be npc-ed for portal conveniences
2/16 01:07:36.516  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/16 01:07:44.880  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and beckons the other two along.
2/16 01:07:45.483  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Of course. That's why I'm sent anyway...
2/16 01:07:47.442  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears.
2/16 01:08:03.359  Irrissia-ArgentDawn groans. "Just had to put on something adapted..."
2/16 01:08:05.735  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And if Vashira is available, maybe she would like benefit from meeting some of the associates of Starlight.
2/16 01:08:11.156  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not only that, also to be a voice of reason.
2/16 01:08:20.934  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "No pressure..."
2/16 01:08:26.525  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ehm... like to.
2/16 01:08:30.219  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I will propose her, if she is around.
2/16 01:08:42.353  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Going to poof here
2/16 01:08:47.964  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yep yep
2/16 01:08:54.725  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yup.

2/16 01:09:12.225  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Again I went towards the spire!

2/16 20:15:02.067  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Curiosity. Do you want to come yourself in tonight meeting ?
2/16 20:15:24.718  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Hmm... nothing there 
2/16 20:15:38.724  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] At my families ancestral manor. It's close to a leyline, and inside a valley.
2/16 20:15:50.609  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My curiosity was tickled when I heard of your endeavour. If you have more details to share, I would be interested to hear them.

2/16 20:16:00.708  Tylwen nods at Dathranion.
2/16 20:16:33.694  Glaivewind-ArgentDawn looks over to Tylwen then the rest of the people, making sure to memorise everyone's thoughts on the matter. "A place that requires all type of talent is welcomed."
2/16 20:16:36.758  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of course, of course. I got many things, though some i cannot fully say or talk about in general just yet as i haven't heard back from all my contacts and other such things.
2/16 20:16:40.518  Stormdággér-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I see. Well, if you like, i can join your little group here tonight? You never know when you'll need a Priestess after all.
2/16 20:16:44.351  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Naturally.
2/16 20:16:45.330  Arandell-ArgentDawn bows his head towards Arlien and then inclines his head towards the crowd.
2/16 20:16:46.118  Arlièn-ArgentDawn shakes her head to Tessaemay: "I was merely curious myself. But I should see to a matter still."
2/16 20:17:03.246  Tylwen smiles at Stormdággér.
2/16 20:17:06.819  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A matter ?
2/16 20:17:22.947  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We wouldn't say no to haveing an extra pair of hands and the willingness of the goddess on our side.
2/16 20:17:47.266  Stormdággér-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, don't get too ahead of yourself. I wont be ruining my robe hammering in nails or carrying bags but-
2/16 20:17:52.216  Stormdággér-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will provide moral support!
2/16 20:17:55.167  Stormdággér smirks slyly at Tylwen.
2/16 20:17:58.734  Salhilan-ArgentDawn chuckles.
2/16 20:17:59.521  Tylwen-ArgentDawn Slowly stood up and folded both arms behind his back.
2/16 20:18:01.706  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles to Arandell and inclines her head to him.
2/16 20:18:04.809  Tylwen smiles at Stormdággér.
2/16 20:18:20.800  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nor would i expect you to do such a thing just yet sister.
2/16 20:18:41.278  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Did you have a question though Lord Dathranion?
2/16 20:18:56.779  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Some strange news from Darkshore. I wanted to see if I could sent some over to have a look, to hear if it needs further investigation.
2/16 20:19:14.291  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "Good luck, then. You are sure you don't need me...?"
2/16 20:19:21.083  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Tessa seeking a way out desesperate xD
2/16 20:19:22.848  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow at Arlien.
2/16 20:19:46.616  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What difference do you plan for this settlement, when compared to the ones already present? Like Astranaar, for example. 
2/16 20:20:01.185  Uodrieth has come online.
2/16 20:20:06.536  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If any, that is.

2/16 20:22:24.223  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Better protected, for the first. As for now, the sisterhood still have declined my efforts to create a ward around these settlements. - That and not only would i ask the help of the sisterhood but the druids of our kin to lend their aid. together with »
2/16 20:22:24.953  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » all of that, we also intent, with the help of a friend of mine to prehaps recreate a few golem guards like those of old. -that's what i can say publicly about such at least, though there's other things too.
2/16 20:22:26.311  Arlièn-ArgentDawn gives Tessaemay a comforting smile.
2/16 20:22:58.731  Arandell-ArgentDawn wrinkles his nose.
2/16 20:23:26.798  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn purses her lips and narrows her eyes slightly.
2/16 20:23:34.591  |Kq24|k whispers: Training? What kind?
2/16 20:23:45.568  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Tylwen a moment, adjusting her hair softly.
2/16 20:23:47.068  To |Kq24|k: physical training with work
2/16 20:24:12.943  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively.
2/16 20:24:49.322  Salhilan-ArgentDawn frowns faintly, yet remains silent.
2/16 20:24:49.769  To |Kq24|k: Every wednesday we have a fitness instructor over who helps with some simple exercises after work, was quite fun
2/16 20:25:03.556  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And in truth, that is approximately what I was hoping to hear. It is a shame that some remain who still refuse to let go of old superstition - especially in these dire times. Although I cannot join as a settler, I may be interested in taking part and »
2/16 20:25:04.488  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » aiding your efforts, in some manner. It is a noble ambition you have.

2/16 20:25:51.024  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I wish to protect all our kin, not those few "Elites".
2/16 20:25:52.291  Stormdággér-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May Elune guide your path.
2/16 20:25:54.023  Tylwen nods.
2/16 20:25:54.223  Dathranion nods at Tylwen.
2/16 20:25:54.223  Stormdággér bows down graciously.
2/16 20:25:57.346  Salhilan-ArgentDawn dips his head.
2/16 20:25:59.371  Rhovanc bows before Stormdággér.
2/16 20:26:05.500  Arandell-ArgentDawn folds his arms behind his back.
2/16 20:26:17.458  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thank you.
2/16 20:26:58.674  To |Kq24|k: That will be tough, if it was anything like my experience. Suddenly my body remembered al sorts of muscles.
2/16 20:27:05.508  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There is no such thing as elites...
2/16 20:27:10.451  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of course, brother. I do not wish to see a single life lost anymore. hence my reffort to make safe areas and build this smaller settlement as fast as i can.
2/16 20:27:14.281  Tylwen nods at Salhilan.
2/16 20:27:22.859  Salhilan-ArgentDawn smiles at Tylwen.
2/16 20:27:25.631  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very true.
2/16 20:27:43.057  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We are no longer "noble" or "low" borns of any kind.
2/16 20:27:54.413  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We are simply one kin, together we either stand or fall
2/16 20:27:56.910  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed.
2/16 20:28:04.877  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And i for one do not intent to see us fall to our enamies
2/16 20:28:14.909  Tylwen-ArgentDawn Enemies*
2/16 20:28:23.043  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I do not think any of us do.
2/16 20:28:23.810  |Kq24|k whispers: I'll be glad to feel them again. All I did was walk the stairs of my apartment. We live on the 11th floor.
2/16 20:28:53.210  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When critical aid is ignorantly refused, it must be offered elsewhere. We did not rejoin our kin to sit idly into the future.
2/16 20:28:57.236  Dathranion-ArgentDawn nods.
2/16 20:30:00.422  To |Kq24|k: That is a lot more than my one flight of stairs between the bedroom and the kitchen
2/16 20:30:50.123  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very true, We shall teach the younger generation about the mistakes of the past, so they may learn from us who lived with them. I do hope that there will come one day where we all will just be one kin again, instead of being held up one against »
2/16 20:30:51.151  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » another.. its by those things divides are created, its by those things, mistakes are bound to happen.
2/16 20:31:23.424  Salhilan-ArgentDawn smiles. "I call you brother for a reason."
2/16 20:31:41.319  Tylwen nods.
2/16 20:32:09.866  Uodrieth has gone offline.
2/16 20:32:21.697  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Unity can be achieved if everyone shares same goal of tolerance and treating one another as equals. I don't trust arcane in particular, but we aren't in position to repeat past mistakes.
2/16 20:32:43.221  Tylwen nods at Alyssrea.
2/16 20:32:46.555  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very true.
2/16 20:33:00.588  Glaivewind-ArgentDawn 's ever permanent frown in the brow retains while she gazes over the guests, perhaps this is an interesting lesson how many interact between one another.
2/16 20:33:21.375  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Right, either way.
2/16 20:33:41.343  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If - all - of you wish to join? or do some of you wish to stay behind
2/16 20:33:47.975  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm coming.
2/16 20:33:51.809  Salhilan-ArgentDawn grins cheerfully.
2/16 20:34:00.476  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Where are you headed? 
2/16 20:34:02.577  Dathranion smiles at Tylwen.
2/16 20:34:05.009  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Then get ready, it will take a bit to walk the way.
2/16 20:34:19.477  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I may have missed out on details. What is the purpose of this meeting?
2/16 20:34:23.343  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Towards Hyjal, there's a valley inbetween the mountains.
2/16 20:34:24.375  Salhilan-ArgentDawn shrugs. "I am good for a walk."
2/16 20:34:25.875  Glaivewind-ArgentDawn nods at Tylwen, clearly ready to begin the journey. With a book in hand of course.
2/16 20:34:31.778  Tylwen smiles at Alyssrea.
2/16 20:34:43.003  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Though if you are riding, I will be flying.
2/16 20:34:47.702  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hm.
2/16 20:34:52.103  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm showing the area i wish to -settle- to those of my order and those that wish to join
2/16 20:35:05.002  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You are coming after all, Moonsong?
2/16 20:35:23.002  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Following the elder.
2/16 20:35:23.736  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, i don't know if everyone here has a mount
2/16 20:35:34.041  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mm.
2/16 20:35:47.803  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We'll I'd offer a ride, but not many get excited by that offer.
2/16 20:35:50.112  Salhilan-ArgentDawn snickers and grins.
2/16 20:36:06.290  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I have some other matter to see to myself.
2/16 20:36:09.828  Glaivewind-ArgentDawn holds her book close with her arms.
2/16 20:36:35.792  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I only know that Ren and i could portal there if need be, though as the rest of you don't know the location, nor do i want you to be made into fresh juice upon arrival i suggest portaling with those that aren't keyed in isn't adviseable.
2/16 20:37:01.059  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am not sure how long I will be present, but I will join you for the duration I am available. My familiar can provide transportation for myself. 
2/16 20:37:10.315  Tylwen nods at Dathranion.
2/16 20:37:14.602  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very well.
2/16 20:37:15.521  Dathranion nods.
2/16 20:37:19.425  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: On OC agenda. Ia is trying to catch Arlien, I think.
2/16 20:38:11.735  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It sounds as though Tylwen is making the Highborne equivalent of the Hermitage xD
2/16 20:38:21.724  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: A little x)
2/16 20:38:34.247  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: ... Bonfire!
2/16 20:38:34.517  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I hope the place doesn't overlap, it would feel weirds
2/16 20:38:46.970  Rhovanc-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How far is it by foot?
2/16 20:39:02.257  Dathranion-ArgentDawn taps a finger against a sapphire-like gem attached to his belt. Arcane energies swiftly stream out of it, forming a sphere in the air that morphs and twists until it assumes the shape of a small flying serpent, translucent and ethereal in appearance.
2/16 20:39:02.503  Tylwen-ArgentDawn Clapped his hands together. "Right, find your sabers, go by foot, or find whatever method of transport you can"
2/16 20:39:16.273  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Draganigos-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/16 20:39:34.090  Salhilan-ArgentDawn nods and looks around at others gathered.
2/16 20:39:49.364  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well I am ready. I left the saddle on Lathari, in case I need her.
2/16 20:39:58.364  Tylwen nods at Salhilan.
2/16 20:40:06.447  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very well, i shall find my own saber.
2/16 20:40:09.352  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: With nets and those man-catchers?
2/16 20:40:13.285  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You have a saber here, Tessaemay?
2/16 20:40:21.918  Tylwen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I shall be back.
2/16 20:40:27.519  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Well... :P
2/16 20:40:29.218  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shivers. "I don't have any saber... I'm scared of them..."
2/16 20:40:32.051  Glaivewind-ArgentDawn looks around.
2/16 20:40:38.376  Rhovanc-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If any are weary for the travel There is soom for another to join me atop Faenor.
2/16 20:40:38.944  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn seats herself on the bench.
2/16 20:40:44.748  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I see you two after ?
2/16 20:40:52.831  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Any other means of transportation? Otherwise there seems to be a spot on the elk. Alternatively, on Alaron. 
2/16 20:40:54.522  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good luck, Tessa. Stay safe.
2/16 20:41:14.646  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Tessaemay: "We will be here."
2/16 20:41:16.414  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Tessa.
2/16 20:41:19.941  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arlien and Arandell, seemingly lacking any sort of cofidence, her ears lowered on her shoulder.
2/16 20:41:22.340  Salhilan-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'll call my chimaera then.
2/16 20:41:25.321  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good luck.
2/16 20:41:44.379  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I can fly, Dathranion.
2/16 20:41:44.379  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Belive in yourself.
2/16 20:42:11.839  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh. I didn't know you'd sprouted wings.
2/16 20:42:21.636  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: That I dunno.
2/16 20:42:30.962  Dathranion-ArgentDawn smiles coyly. "Let us fly then."
2/16 20:42:34.325  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Druidic training.
2/16 20:42:46.513  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Dathranion Val'anir.
2/16 20:42:55.969  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I would just prefer to walk...
2/16 20:43:14.134  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It sounds like we have a long distance to go. 
2/16 20:43:21.300  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears.
2/16 20:43:34.635  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How about we start on feet, and then we'll see?
2/16 20:43:45.832  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We can always take to the skies, if need be.
2/16 20:43:53.077  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Dathranion Val'anir.
2/16 20:43:58.755  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sounds good, yes.
2/16 20:45:05.046  Dathranion-ArgentDawn nods, then looks down at his serpentine familiar. "You heard her." He squints, and the magical creature whirls around before losing the shape it had, turning once more into a crackling sphere before reforming into something akin to a hound. With a »
2/16 20:45:05.478  Dathranion-ArgentDawn » wiggling tail, it looks between the two.
2/16 20:45:35.510  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] By Aessina. I pray Ellemayne to never see that trick...
2/16 20:45:42.243  Dathranion snickers at Irrissia.
2/16 20:45:44.977  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Last time another familiar showed something, she copied it.
2/16 20:46:15.911  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, this one has shapeshifting abilities beyond the ordinary. 
2/16 20:46:56.137  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Then I'll keep Ellemayne far away...
2/16 20:46:59.667  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mm.
2/16 20:47:07.252  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Safe journey, Arlien.
2/16 20:47:24.628  Dathranion-ArgentDawn dips his head, smiling warmly. 
2/16 20:47:25.652  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Dathranion in farewell: "To you as well. Ana'thoras-ethil."
2/16 20:47:38.565  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head slightly.
2/16 20:47:48.334  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hope we shall get a chance to speak more at length, the next time we meet. Too often our encounters are too brief.
2/16 20:47:54.333  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Stars guide your footsteps. 
2/16 20:48:14.938  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Duty often dictates such.
2/16 20:48:32.971  Arandell-ArgentDawn huffs. "One more to the list."
2/16 20:48:34.567  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Tylwen Starlight.
2/16 20:48:49.352  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed, yet us elders must afford ourselves a little something on occasion, no?
2/16 20:48:51.328  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of course. Unless you suddenly prefer to pass on the Hermitage support ?
2/16 20:48:57.484  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The list never ends, hm?
2/16 20:48:59.140  Alyssrea smirks slyly at Arandell.
2/16 20:48:59.836  |Kq24|k whispers: :)
2/16 20:49:02.710  Nitzuss waves at Irrissia.
2/16 20:49:25.650  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Nitzuss Nimblewind, politely.
2/16 20:49:27.807  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, sister.

2/16 20:49:37.938  Nitzuss waves at Tylwen.
2/16 20:49:39.903  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I have wings, don't worry. And feet work well too.
2/16 20:49:55.818  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Eveninf Nitzuss. Arlien is heading to the Darkshore, she might need your assistance.
2/16 20:49:56.467  Arlièn-ArgentDawn chuckles and nodsto Dathranion: "We can try. Thusfar with little succes unless I am forced to it."
2/16 20:50:01.699  Nitzuss nods at Irrissia.
2/16 20:50:06.301  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances at Alyssrea. "Suprisingly short for a while."
2/16 20:50:14.765  Nitzuss bows before Glaivewind.
2/16 20:50:14.956  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He is comming.
2/16 20:50:32.094  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thank you, Tessaemay.
2/16 20:50:35.660  Alyssrea giggles at Arandell.
2/16 20:50:43.117  Dathranion-ArgentDawn chuckles softly. "Then I shall be forcing you next time." He winks, before turning and walking after Tessaemay.
2/16 20:50:45.711  Nitzuss bows down graciously.
2/16 20:50:51.214  Dathranion bows before Nitzuss.
2/16 20:50:56.096  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Darkshore..?

2/16 20:50:59.627  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A reason to stab...
2/16 20:51:05.844  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Nitzuss with a smile.
2/16 20:51:08.657  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Dathranion Val'anir.

2/16 20:51:39.012  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn inclines her head.
2/16 20:51:44.428  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn nods in greeting.
2/16 20:51:45.486  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] [Low] Why do you need to speak with Arlien...?
2/16 20:51:48.738  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Blessed eve.
2/16 20:51:51.784  Nitzuss bows down graciously.
2/16 20:51:56.631  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Ialluen and Falyra.
2/16 20:51:58.806  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I pray I am not disturbing?
2/16 20:52:00.779  Falyra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, Sisters and Brothers.
2/16 20:52:01.491  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune, Priestess, Falyra.
2/16 20:52:11.788  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] In a prying mood today, are we?
2/16 20:52:15.132  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Dathranion Val'anir.
2/16 20:52:16.815  Dathranion smirks slyly at Irrissia.
2/16 20:52:22.144  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm curious.
2/16 20:52:23.295  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and inclines her head in greeting.
2/16 20:52:30.407  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Disturbance can only improve things.
2/16 20:52:45.994  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Maybe I will tell you along the way, hm?
2/16 20:52:50.286  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Dathranion Val'anir.
2/16 20:52:53.512  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Wonderful. Than I am happy to say that I may offer such. 
2/16 20:52:58.668  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Are you busy, sister Snowshade?
2/16 20:53:10.205  Uodrieth has come online.
2/16 20:53:34.221  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I can spare a moment, but let me see to one thing first if it is not urgent?
2/16 20:53:41.632  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn inclines her head towards the sentinels.
2/16 20:53:51.293  Dathranion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We will begin on foot. Tessaemay insists - then we will likely take to the skies and catch up with you there. 
2/16 20:54:19.473  Dathranion nods at Tylwen.
2/16 20:54:24.525  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is not particularly urgent, no. Moreso a curious matter in itself, perhaps.
2/16 20:54:32.592  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I am nothing if not patient.
2/16 20:55:01.913  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Iâlluen. She looks to Nitzuss and Alyssrae.
2/16 20:55:23.335  Syruné has come online.
2/16 20:55:34.177  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn side-eyes back towards Arlien.
2/16 20:56:04.842  Arandell-ArgentDawn keeps his hands folded behind his back and glances towards the southeast bridge with a frown.
2/16 20:56:09.157  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nitzuss, I had hoped you could go to Darkshore and see what this news is about? If you are willing, Alyssrea, you could join her?
2/16 20:56:59.405  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods firmly. "It will be my pleasure to help, Elder. What's the situation?"
2/16 20:57:09.903  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] TRouble afoot, I hear?
2/16 20:57:32.531  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods once, "Certainly, Keeper."
2/16 20:58:25.848  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I got word from Milaelor Shadestrike, in the small camp not far from Auberdine. The news itself was rather vague that is why I would like you to follow up on it. He asked for help with some aging animals.
2/16 20:58:45.489  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn perks an eyebrow.

2/16 20:58:54.832  Uodrieth has gone offline.
2/16 20:59:04.626  Yier has gone offline.
2/16 20:59:38.106  Yier has come online.
2/16 20:59:45.809  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It could mean a few things and I am just not certain. That is why I would ask you to go seek him out and get some more information.
2/16 21:00:19.817  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods firmly. "Suggested precautions?"
2/16 21:01:15.041  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn links her hands together, listening for now.
2/16 21:01:16.502  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Simply investigate and don't try anything on your own. If you have news, bring it back to him and to us here in Astranaar.
2/16 21:01:46.424  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Unless you ofcourse deem it so insignificant that you can handle it, but I doubt he would sent a message for that.
2/16 21:03:12.918  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Understood.
2/16 21:03:45.584  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods once and unseats herself. "Acknowledged."
2/16 21:04:05.876  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good, thank you.
2/16 21:04:23.846  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We'll report back as soon as we have any new information.
2/16 21:04:49.432  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head to the gathered. "Blessed eve."
2/16 21:05:09.069  Nitzuss bows before you.
2/16 21:05:09.069  Falyra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, Sister.
2/16 21:05:15.405  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Dalathria.
2/16 21:05:24.512  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Dalathria.
2/16 21:05:25.290  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good hunting, Sisters.
2/16 21:05:27.497  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn nods in greeting.
2/16 21:05:35.001  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If there is nothing else, we'll get right to it. Enjoy your evening, goddess' grace.
2/16 21:05:37.999  Arlièn-ArgentDawn dips her head to Nitzuss and Alyssrea once more.
2/16 21:05:39.543  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Stay safe.
2/16 21:05:47.389  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods.
2/16 21:05:50.434  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods politely towards Dalathria.
2/16 21:05:51.425  Dungeon Difficulty set to Heroic.
2/16 21:05:51.461  You have invited Alyssrea to join your group.
2/16 21:05:52.721  Alyssrea joins the party.
2/16 21:05:54.488  You have invited Nitzuss to join your group.
2/16 21:05:56.372  Nitzuss joins the party.
2/16 21:06:01.803  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Travel safe, sister.
2/16 21:06:07.070  Falyra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Elune be with you.
2/16 21:06:22.895  Alyssrea salutes you with respect.
2/16 21:06:39.707  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Moonlight guide.
2/16 21:07:04.214  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Just a small little investigation, a lead up to the next events. I will see if I can come on over in a moment, but let me just talk with Ialluen.
2/16 21:07:17.386  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: oki :)
2/16 21:07:29.961  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: ill go pretend to get ready :P
2/16 21:07:43.603  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Just head on over, the travel is quite a distance.
2/16 21:08:11.282  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What had you wished to speak about, Priestess?
2/16 21:08:24.020  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: we'll RP travel there as you talk - no rush 
2/16 21:08:27.020  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] One might call it private concerns.
2/16 21:08:35.470  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: :)
2/16 21:09:04.106  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ofcourse, lead the way.
2/16 21:09:05.556  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How private?
2/16 21:09:12.296  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly.
2/16 21:09:31.410  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You should know now that I do not take issue with your presence, Moonsong.
2/16 21:09:34.176  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn dares a faint smile.
2/16 21:10:01.900  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Regardless, better be certain than assume.
2/16 21:10:26.477  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of course. Shall we?
2/16 21:10:59.823  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/16 21:11:00.744  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "The pier or the townhall?"
2/16 21:11:15.470  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Pier will do.
2/16 21:11:34.886  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Deniand-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/16 21:12:01.378  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I cannot claim this to be particularly important, but I do have a question. Or two, perhaps.
2/16 21:12:12.448  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn turns around, studying Arlien for a moment, all whilst brushing back her cowl.
2/16 21:12:46.778  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ask away, if I can provide with an answer I shall.
2/16 21:13:29.941  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn studies Arlien for a moment.
2/16 21:13:47.424  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I spoke to Moonspyre last night. For... well, reasons. Half the cadre did, but that is a different matter entirely.
2/16 21:14:20.785  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head while listening.
2/16 21:14:36.491  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She did mention that you might be concerned about my opinion of you. Is that true?
2/16 21:15:01.549  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn looks towards Arlien with a curious gaze.
2/16 21:15:50.429  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am somewhat, yes. That is why I approached you a while ago here in Astranaar.
2/16 21:16:17.603  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Dare I perhaps ask for an elaboration to where this comes from?
2/16 21:16:18.470  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: *jumps off the pier*
2/16 21:16:27.997  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn sounds about as curious as she looks. A tad concerned, perhaps.
2/16 21:17:54.473  Gwydhienne has come online.
2/16 21:18:40.116  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When I first returned from my seclusion, you and the Nightblades were there as only a handfull of our kin. I had grown fond of you and the others, Annaeya in particular.
2/16 21:18:51.577  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn nods.
2/16 21:18:54.003  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That I recall.
2/16 21:18:55.694  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: we're talking up darkshore slowly
2/16 21:19:01.475  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: want me to stall?
2/16 21:19:51.128  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: nvm
2/16 21:20:16.568  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I feared I pushed you to far at one point in Feralas and that we since grew apart. That is why I sought ammends here in Astranaar.
2/16 21:21:04.946  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn cants her head slightly.
2/16 21:21:21.437  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I do recall you apologising, but I have to admit that I never understood why you sought to do it. 
2/16 21:21:35.169  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And I recall saying that too. That I saw no reason for you too.
2/16 21:22:02.686  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Just drop me a line when you are at the Refugee camp near Auberdine
2/16 21:22:34.324  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I did not interpet it so. Perhaps because I at times overthink to much.
2/16 21:22:58.555  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: strategic manouvering around the trial
2/16 21:23:22.732  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, as much can happen to the best of us.
2/16 21:23:39.405  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Aran so wants to just bluntly bring that up.
2/16 21:23:41.593  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: is it the one with fires or the docks?
2/16 21:23:52.970  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Still, I do wish to ask makes as much be true? I must admit that I am a little confused to why my opinion holds any weight in the first place.
2/16 21:23:56.314  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn dares a faint smile.
2/16 21:24:40.706  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: man auberdine ruins looks cool
2/16 21:24:50.549  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: i love the alliance version
2/16 21:24:57.415  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: as in, this one
2/16 21:25:08.128  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: we're here ^^
2/16 21:25:44.075  Arandell-ArgentDawn adjusts his belt and surcoat as he listens, followed by raising his eyebrow.
2/16 21:25:44.652  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You are of the Sisterhood, the leaders of our kin. And more than that, I value you as person because you were there.
2/16 21:26:22.327  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] In Feralas?
2/16 21:26:43.828  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Iâlluen: "Were you not there, we might not be here now."
2/16 21:27:10.475  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Why does my map show you still in Ashenvale :-/
2/16 21:27:19.705  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/16 21:27:25.978  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: buggy game
2/16 21:27:27.680  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: weird :/
2/16 21:28:23.576  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is a statement of no small weight, sister. Naturally, I am honoured by those words. 
2/16 21:28:26.522  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You arrive at the camp outside of Auberdine. Where first it was meant for refugees, it now functions as a forward base and hunting camp for the inhabitants of Darkshore. A few hunters and sentinels are there.
2/16 21:29:51.664  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I do however belong to the kind of people that puts little to no value in my title, or the affiliation I have with the Sisterhood. I live to serve, not to demand respect out of the kin around me. Goddess above.
2/16 21:30:11.187  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: Do we emote and say in pchat?
2/16 21:30:15.840  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Yes please
2/16 21:30:20.705  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea spends a while looking around and exchanging throughts with Nitzuss as they arrive. As Aly sees the hunters and sentinels, she salutes her comrades in arms and greets them*
2/16 21:31:00.350  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Searches the area with her eyes briefly before joining in greeting her sisters and brothers*
2/16 21:31:21.973  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No - we might not always share the same opinion, or agree on how matters are best resolved or seen to. I serve with a sentinel cadre, and you lead the Hermitage. We are quite bound to having different views on matters, no?
2/16 21:32:22.701  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is very much true. But even if we say we hold little value to our rank, it gives us some regardeless.
2/16 21:32:47.766  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn curiously studies Arlien as she speaks. There is no ire in her tone, more so the ever-present and tangible curiosity. As so often otherwise.
2/16 21:33:05.491  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The sentinels return the salute, offering you both a place at the fire and something to drink. THey can see you have had a long journey.*
2/16 21:33:26.639  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Unfortunate or fortunate as it is at times.
2/16 21:34:01.547  Iâlluen looks at Arandell.
2/16 21:35:48.338  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: * The area looks fairly normal for what you would expect from such a camp, there is some game being prepared, leathers being tanned and the sentinels and civilians are chatting with each other idly.*
2/16 21:36:41.082  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *gratefully accepts the water with a bow but remains standing. "Elune'adore, sisters. We come from Ashenvale seeking word of Milaelor Shadestrike. Have you seen him?"
2/16 21:37:08.609  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As fortunate or unfortunate it may be brother, I fear that I am not inclined to change my opinion on that matter. I am not particularly traditional in that sense.
2/16 21:37:11.640  Iâlluen looks at you.
2/16 21:37:21.940  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I assume that is another point in where we do not see eye to eye, hm?
2/16 21:37:24.645  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn looks somewhat amused.
2/16 21:38:16.588  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Think you two are more alike in few such matters, as far as I learned.
2/16 21:38:42.711  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea joins the sentinels by fire and accepts the drink with a warm, yet somewhat firm smile. With Nitzuss already proceeding with the talk, she lets he do so, and takes a superficial look towards her surroundings in the camp*
2/16 21:38:43.328  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: "Or her." she adds.
2/16 21:38:44.065  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I have served the Sisterhood for a very long time.
2/16 21:39:37.918  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn links her hands together, listening for now.
2/16 21:40:14.840  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: They point you out to a willowy man, it might be a druid or hunter, you can not quite tell from his outfit. He stands a little ways away, with two cages.
2/16 21:41:52.244  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It might have been different if I had been part of the Cenarion Circle, but that never came to be. As such it was always the priestess in the village that took the lead. It is difficult to shake.
2/16 21:42:24.331  Vashíra has come online.
2/16 21:42:39.268  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Hi all!
2/16 21:42:40.175  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea finishes her drink and bows her head towards the sentinels, moving towards the man pointed as Shadestrike. She perks her brow as her eyes meet the cages, studying what kinds of animals were inside* "Greetings, brother." 
2/16 21:42:44.759  |Kq18|k whispers: Oh, back already?
2/16 21:42:47.702  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Heyhey :-)
2/16 21:42:49.879  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: hey vash :)
2/16 21:43:01.572  To |Kq18|k: I haven't left, jsut juggling two things at the same time xD
2/16 21:43:05.528  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: hi vash
2/16 21:43:18.725  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That I can understand. 
2/16 21:43:29.608  |Kq18|k whispers: Ah :)

2/16 21:44:00.795  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And I do tend to give space and time when I think it is needed, sometimes a little to much.
2/16 21:44:12.460  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss follows Alyssrea, getting a closer look at the man. As she approaches she inclines her form politely.*
2/16 21:44:28.330  |Kq18|k whispers: Do i start with the lapoon up?
2/16 21:44:51.317  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "And to you, Sisters. I do not recognise you, but I recognise your sigil. You got my message?" *He looks to Nitzuss. There is a rabbit and a squirrel in the seperate cages*
2/16 21:45:11.025  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: How is everyone?
2/16 21:45:24.479  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: normal.
2/16 21:45:31.419  To |Kq18|k: I usually do, but that is because I fetch the people and take them with me
2/16 21:46:05.395  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/16 21:46:06.389  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] By all means, but I believe there is perhaps a factor here that goes unconsidered, despite us having spoken about it prior. I believe that should be addressed too, if you do not mind?
2/16 21:46:09.589  To |Kq18|k: But yes, you should have it up. Even if you are already at your spot
2/16 21:46:41.615  |Kq18|k whispers: I shall go to the spot. 
2/16 21:46:55.236  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: "We did, Elder Snowshade sent us as swiftly as she could."* She says, glancing at the cages.
2/16 21:46:55.236  To |Kq18|k: It might be a while longer because I am jugling two things currently
2/16 21:47:00.553  |Kq18|k whispers: It's the shrine right?
2/16 21:47:11.167  |Kq18|k whispers: Ah can you give me a signal when i shoudl get in position then?
2/16 21:47:14.960  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, not at all.
2/16 21:48:03.697  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sister Snowshade, know that I say this with all due respect - but I do not believe we know one another well enough to perhaps warrant concerns about the opinions of one another. 
2/16 21:48:07.979  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea, too, eyes towards the cages and asks* "What's the situation?"
2/16 21:48:48.415  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I do not say that for the sake of being crude or diminish the conversation or relation we have in that extent, but I know for a fact that I am a terribly private person, and I can personally say that I know terribly little of you.
2/16 21:48:57.847  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: good thx :)
2/16 21:49:15.083  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "That I understand."
2/16 21:49:19.612  To |Kq18|k: Will do

2/16 21:50:40.983  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Again, with all due respect but... don't you think the concern might be a tad on the extreme side, knowing that?

2/16 21:51:04.343  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn cants her head slightly anew, looking a mixture of concerned and curious. Pale and tired too should be said, but that is likely for different reasons.
2/16 21:51:04.691  Uodrieth has come online.
2/16 21:53:45.457  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea perks her brow and side-eyes towards Nitzuss, giving her an odd, purposeful look before looking back towards Shadestrike* "Why would you require more help with the matter, brother? What happened with these little ones?"
2/16 21:53:58.496  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, I hear you. Perhaps it was a wish for something different that truelly kept me occupied.
2/16 21:54:26.148  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And what would that be, dare I ask?
2/16 21:54:53.412  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss gets closer to the cages, inspecting the critters closely looking for any other signs out of the ordinary.*
2/16 21:55:27.846  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To be able to call you a friend one night, for what you offered me back in Feralas.
2/16 21:55:54.618  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn blinks.
2/16 21:56:11.544  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head slightly.
2/16 21:56:12.795  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "These might be small, but what if it were bigger? Plus! These are the only ones that I caught."
2/16 21:56:23.415  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That... admittedly took me a bit by surprise. What exactly did I offer you in Feralas, dare I ask? Save for the occasional conversation and presence?
2/16 21:57:20.156  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] For me it was enough. I was lost after my time away, that was difficult.
2/16 21:57:45.556  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/16 21:57:54.762  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: "Are there more of these in the wilds? And are they a posing a significant threat?" 
2/16 21:58:39.489  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/16 21:58:40.006  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn dips her head in a polite fashion at that.
2/16 21:59:01.288  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am delighted to hear that it made a difference.
2/16 21:59:14.087  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *If you look over the squirrel, you can see how it's furr is recolouring as you look at it from a winter furr to a summer colour. Quite a curious sight.* "That is what I would like to find out, that is why I asked you"
2/16 22:00:09.623  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and bows her head to Iâlluen in thanks.
2/16 22:01:08.063  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles briefly.
2/16 22:02:34.850  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That being said - no, sister Snowshade, we might not always see eye to eye, but merciful heavens above, it might be a good idea to stop being concerned about my opinion of you. 
2/16 22:02:49.477  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune
2/16 22:02:51.928  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/16 22:03:06.484  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I shall endeavour to do so.
2/16 22:03:16.413  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] First and foremost, it is none you need to worry about, and second of all, it is not an opinion that matters particularly much in the first place, even if it was of a corrosive nature - which I stress that it isn't.
2/16 22:03:52.255  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums a greeting to Vashíra and inclines her head: "Ishnu-alah, Vashira."
2/16 22:03:55.337  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/16 22:03:56.292  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss nods gently at the man.* "Have you seen any tendecies of it spreading? Is it only localized to the ruins?"
2/16 22:03:56.571  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/16 22:03:56.816  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/16 22:04:06.715  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Blessed eve, sister Ravenheart.
2/16 22:04:09.935  Nianthia has gone offline.
2/16 22:04:26.014  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hope I'm not interupting anything?
2/16 22:04:29.020  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Could we seek you out in a little bit, Vashira? Nitzuss is still away but I expect her to return before long.
2/16 22:04:40.478  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Offcourse.
2/16 22:04:41.457  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/16 22:04:48.822  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thank you.
2/16 22:04:49.084  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head at Vashira.
2/16 22:04:51.624  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Vashíra.
2/16 22:05:52.621  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Indeed, indeed! they are coming from that place and the crew there is not helping either."
2/16 22:06:05.286  To |Kq18|k: Till what time do you have?
2/16 22:06:14.047  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: Hey, I dno but I heard Elrinde and Tharandrel were going up here
2/16 22:06:22.859  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: "The crew, brother?"
2/16 22:06:29.896  Uodrieth has gone offline.
2/16 22:06:31.544  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: Would it be ok to ask about them? Or is it not relevant anyway
2/16 22:06:32.216  |Kq18|k whispers: Euhm..how long is the scouting thing gonna take? xD
2/16 22:07:20.762  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn looks back towards Arlien. 
2/16 22:07:21.854  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "That part of Auberdine is still being cleared, but they are none to kind about it and do not seem to making any progress. When I tried to warn them they just laughted it off!"
2/16 22:07:44.208  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thank you, Ialluen. I appreciate that.
2/16 22:07:44.208  Merimas-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] This is Astranaar, my dears.

2/16 22:08:37.440  To |Kq18|k: shouldn't take that much longer, but I don't want to get you into trouble either xD
2/16 22:08:45.303  To |Kq18|k: Just so I have a moment that I know to cut it off
2/16 22:09:04.604  |Kq18|k whispers: I got a bit of time, but i prefer not to sit here doing nothing for a hour or more xD
2/16 22:09:24.067  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I only seek to clarify what I cannot understand, that would be all.
2/16 22:10:19.955  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: "Can you be more specific? Are they our own forces or hired help from elsewhere?"
2/16 22:12:08.291  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "And you clarified much to me as well. Did you wish to ask more, or were those two questions you mentioned earlier?"
2/16 22:12:23.357  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: xD Tessa is so fed up of all of them
2/16 22:12:27.099  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That would quite literally be it.
2/16 22:12:35.374  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Of all of who?
2/16 22:12:54.294  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Highbornes and else
2/16 22:13:05.898  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: "Warn them of what? Blight?"* Nitzuss says, watching over towards the ruins.*
2/16 22:13:08.468  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Nuke them all!
2/16 22:13:23.648  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: They are all becoming super overbearing she is about to shapeshift and flapflap away
2/16 22:14:04.250  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Bah! Definitely not local. Even if they say they fall under one of our own. The seals are convincing enough. You will have to take a closer look yourself." *He looks to Nitzuss:* "No, of this!" *Milaelor gestures to the two critters.
2/16 22:15:16.319  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I know I am repeating myself, but thank you for elaborating.
2/16 22:15:36.024  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: "How much do you know them, to be precise, brother? Certainly the matter at hand might look relatively small but coming from a group which gets little to nothing done... I can see why you feel concerned."
2/16 22:15:40.424  To |Kq18|k: I'll go whip their buts into gear ;-)
2/16 22:15:59.808  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Don't mention it. I am simply confused. 
2/16 22:16:00.467  |Kq18|k whispers: Who joined Nitz?
2/16 22:16:25.241  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I still cannot really piece together whatever trangression you believe you did that caused this to be a matter of concern in the first place.
2/16 22:16:26.022  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks over Iâlluen: "More than that, it seems. Are you alright?"
2/16 22:16:27.493  |Kq18|k whispers: Brb
2/16 22:16:33.230  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Gonna be right back!
2/16 22:16:41.721  To |Kq18|k: Alyssrae
2/16 22:17:29.077  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Quite. At least in this matter.
2/16 22:17:52.690  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Not much more. Bunch of different races, not Kaldorei. I did not get much time to look into it, first when they kicked me out and I still have to work you know."
2/16 22:18:30.624  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perhaps not quite what the question was about.
2/16 22:18:43.709  Iâlluen looks at Arandell.
2/16 22:19:11.076  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I understood that, brother. What I speak about however, might be restricted to the answer I gave.
2/16 22:19:26.685  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn studies Arandell for a moment, with no lacking amount of curiosity still.
2/16 22:19:30.258  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Back
2/16 22:19:50.246  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Iâlluen: "I hear you."
2/16 22:19:51.535  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Fair enough. Was simply curios myself as well.
2/16 22:19:54.888  |Kq18|k whispers: Its at the shrine of Aessina right, were we normally do it?
2/16 22:20:06.896  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly, giving a brief smile.
2/16 22:20:20.258  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea nods firmly, her expression grows more solemn* "Suspicious enough to look into."
2/16 22:20:55.318  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "If you want to check it out, it is on the south side of Auberdine. It is not that far from here."
2/16 22:20:55.906  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss nods at the man before looking to Alyssrea,*"What do you say, sister? Should we go and have a look?"
2/16 22:21:19.551  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Again, I am a private person in nature.
2/16 22:21:43.617  |Kq18|k whispers: Should i go there?
2/16 22:22:04.071  To |Kq18|k: Normally it is at the huntress statue, just outside of Astranaar
2/16 22:22:11.948  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Aly looks towards Nitzuss and nods* "I'll refuse to leave without seeing to this ourselves." *he looks towards Shadestrike once more* "Thank you for informing us, brother. Are there any precautions you suggest us taking while we investigate?"
2/16 22:22:18.901  |Kq18|k whispers: I;ll go there then!
2/16 22:22:22.717  To |Kq18|k: Just linger around a little bit in Astranaar, I'd say ;-)
2/16 22:22:28.206  |Kq18|k whispers: Ok
2/16 22:22:28.910  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I fear that extends to what might perhaps be ailing me as well.
2/16 22:23:02.234  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed. That is why I will not ask further. Although we will gladly assist, if you choose to ask.
2/16 22:23:16.492  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums in agreement with Arandell.
2/16 22:24:03.822  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Don't get your butt kicked like I did, but you do look more than capable yourself."
2/16 22:24:10.219  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The thought is appreciated, brother. 
2/16 22:24:20.037  To |Kq18|k: You got the location now, right?
2/16 22:24:41.223  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss thanks Shadestrike with a gentle bow.*
2/16 22:24:58.304  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea bows her head and turns towards Nitzuss* 
2/16 22:25:07.824  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Elune'adore." *He says with a bow of his own.*
2/16 22:25:13.502  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head slightly.
2/16 22:25:36.382  |Kq18|k whispers: I know the statue yes, but im not there yet. Do you want me to go there now?
2/16 22:25:50.047  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is there anything else you wish from me on this topic?
2/16 22:25:53.808  Iâlluen looks at you.
2/16 22:25:59.957  To |Kq18|k: No, no. Just want to avoid a Makhalann situation that he walked to the wrong location xD
2/16 22:26:22.935  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, just a time to sit and talk one of these nights I would enjoy.
2/16 22:26:48.577  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks up for a moment: "But I fear I must first go see to a different matter again."
2/16 22:27:06.131  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] By all means. Do stay safe. Elune's grace. 
2/16 22:27:17.494  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh. Refreshing change. On someone else's list.
2/16 22:27:27.158  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly.
2/16 22:27:41.889  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and bows her head in farewell to Ialluen, chuckling briefly to Arandell.
2/16 22:27:56.151  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Ialluen.
2/16 22:27:56.365  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn nods towards the pair prior taking her leave.
2/16 22:28:38.677  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I ought to dress up for when Nitzuss returns, Vashira will properly initiate her into the Hermitage.
2/16 22:28:50.145  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, think you made large circles, but went well enough in the end.
2/16 22:28:52.368  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: And I need to run to Darkshore to DM the rest of this little thing.
2/16 22:28:52.368  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh?
2/16 22:29:16.586  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Hehe. Aight.
2/16 22:29:17.640  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I enjoy large circles. But seek out Vashira, I will see you soon.
2/16 22:29:19.448  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea finds high ground to take a look towards south of Auberdine from distance, her eyes seeking the specific group of outsiders or anything off around the town while the sentinel calculated their odds of approach*
2/16 22:29:28.345  Arandell-ArgentDawn bows his head.
2/16 22:29:34.149  Arlièn-ArgentDawn dips her head to Arandell.

2/16 22:31:05.005  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (on my way, you now have my undivived attention. Thank you for letting me have a chat with Ialluen, was great for my personal char ;-))
2/16 22:31:40.919  Yier has gone offline.
2/16 22:33:37.596  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It takes a moment to scout out the proper location, but then you see the part he meant. A few other races are taking care of the rubble, or at least pretending to do so.
2/16 22:35:07.540  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Can you make me a roll?
2/16 22:35:16.385  Alyssrea rolls 6 (1-20)
2/16 22:35:40.551  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (my dice is on the roll again... at least it wasn't 1 or 2...)
2/16 22:36:11.292  |Kq24|k whispers: hi dear, are you in Astranaar?
2/16 22:36:39.774  Iâlluen has gone offline.
2/16 22:36:40.831  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss gazes out across the ruins and inspects the working crew, in particular trying to make out any signs or seals of their belonging*
2/16 22:37:07.621  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It is difficult with the rubble and the remnants of buildings are blocking your view. You think you spot two humans and a...gnoll?
2/16 22:37:44.687  To |Kq24|k: IC yes, OC I am away.
2/16 22:37:50.763  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Should I make a roll too?
2/16 22:37:58.002  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: please
2/16 22:38:01.584  Nitzuss rolls 4 (1-20)
2/16 22:38:12.234  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: (-.-)
2/16 22:38:31.007  To |Kq24|k: Just running a little adventure
2/16 22:39:03.832  |Kq24|k whispers: nice. well I won't disturb. Mer is in Astranaar with her mate and their children.
2/16 22:39:14.498  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It is to far away to clearly make out, but you do spot a few more people. More than you could take on in a fight, and just the two of you might be an issue.
2/16 22:39:38.851  To |Kq24|k: Oh, that is nice :-) We do have a little ritual in a little bit to initiate Nitzuss
2/16 22:39:54.243  |Kq24|k whispers: I love initiations. :)
2/16 22:40:30.148  To |Kq24|k: Stay clsoe to Arandell and Vashira
2/16 22:41:02.236  |Kq24|k whispers: Aran is here, getting himself tea
2/16 22:42:43.110  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* What do you think? I saw a gnoll with them, definitely not my ordinary company.
2/16 22:43:26.199  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We could get a closer look.
2/16 22:43:41.700  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn slips off her spot and looks towards Nitzuss, slightly conflicted. "I'd want to take a closer look, but without exposing too much of our intentions here. What do you think of a diplomatic approach - saying we are from the camp and seeing how the »
2/16 22:43:41.932  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn » efforts here are going."
2/16 22:45:03.295  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think they'll give us the boot much like our friend back there.
2/16 22:45:49.137  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But it would be worth the try.
2/16 22:47:01.082  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Sorry, I missed this bit
2/16 22:47:01.910  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: Vash told me that tonight there will be Nitz ceremony. Since I knew that now, I have  alittle TRP extended item to gift her for it, I would be grateful to have the opportunity at the end"
2/16 22:47:09.975  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm... Even then, if there's a problem, we'll have to find out.
2/16 22:47:24.366  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: It's me, Khabane Lame
2/16 22:47:39.958  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We report back either way, and boot them off our lands if the Elder deems it fitting.
2/16 22:47:49.337  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: dansgame
2/16 22:47:52.495  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods firmly, "Sounds good."
2/16 22:48:01.299  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Certainly, just tell Vashira she'll lead the ritual
2/16 22:48:50.738  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Lets see if we can get a closer look first, before we charge in.
2/16 22:48:55.307  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: ok thanks
2/16 22:49:17.077  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: lil bro!
2/16 22:49:28.896  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A diplomatic approach, shouldn't rub anyone wrong way unless they had something to hide.
2/16 22:49:39.698  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good point.
2/16 22:49:46.082  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Elrinde and Tharandel's is not related to this point
2/16 22:50:17.857  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: you on that layer 8 yet?
2/16 22:50:27.478  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: A chill runs down your spine. An electric tingling.
2/16 22:50:32.369  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: layer 80 by now
2/16 22:50:56.764  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* Something is off here... Is it... arcane?
2/16 22:51:36.011  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: As you approach the bridge, a Dwarf come running towards you in heavy leathers, that are a bit ragged but certainly effective. A few more heads turn through broken walls and windows.
2/16 22:52:20.284  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Oi, no crossing! This is a work in progress, g't lost." *As though in an afterthrought he says:* "You might get hurt."
2/16 22:52:57.142  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn narrows her eyes and looks towards the drawf. "We are from the camp. What is going on?"
2/16 22:53:09.467  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: You think you hear some rifles being loaded.
2/16 22:53:54.136  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "What'ya think it looks like? Clearing rubble and blight, dangerous stuff. -Get- lost.
2/16 22:54:03.084  [9. Community:159037872:1] Tylwen-ArgentDawn: *wave*
2/16 22:54:13.150  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *stabs*
2/16 22:54:20.550  [9. Community:159037872:1] Tylwen-ArgentDawn: wtf
2/16 22:54:22.383  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Or did you mean the other Highborn Arandell?
2/16 22:54:23.685  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Wrong highborne!
2/16 22:54:23.685  [9. Community:159037872:1] Tylwen-ArgentDawn: why so rude
2/16 22:54:25.913  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn 's ears twitch, her expression shifts into more skeptical, less skilled in concealing it than her more shady cousin. But relying on her training, the sentinel didn't seem to believe she needed it.
2/16 22:54:34.395  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Well they all look alike..gjees!
2/16 22:54:34.696  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: But you can stab him a bit too.
2/16 22:54:51.161  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: ffs i died by my own foolness and oinly reason i did layer 6 is just to not die ._.
2/16 22:55:02.029  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: stupid traps

2/16 22:55:37.739  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn examines the area with a watchful eye, taking a deep breath and letting her other senses guide the search too.
2/16 22:55:56.983  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: ye the traps are deadly, always fucked me up
2/16 22:56:19.394  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: im more annoyed i get pushed back by the sliding knife axe
2/16 22:56:24.647  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: and thrown into another trap and into another 
2/16 22:56:35.474  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: so basically 1 mistake gives me 3 deathly traps in a row -.
2/16 22:56:45.405  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: aye haha annoying af
2/16 22:56:45.930  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We don't mean to disturb rebuilding efforts here, but we must be certain of the work being done. I'm not leaving until that is handled, for best interests of my kin and our lands.
2/16 22:56:48.578  [4. LookingForGroup] Ílluminati-ArgentDawn: o/
2/16 22:56:52.595  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn feels the tingle in the air on the hair of her arms, seeking a source for the static.
2/16 22:56:54.009  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: You spot 3 humans taking up some tactical positions behind rubble and walls. They are not carrying their 'diggers' tools anymore.
2/16 22:57:03.135  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: o/
2/16 22:57:07.385  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Gjeees, can the wind calm down please! I can hear stuff getting tossed around outside!

2/16 22:57:25.062  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: DansGame
2/16 22:57:29.737  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn empathises the last part of her last sentence. It was her people and lands of kaldorei. No dwarf was going to boss her around... but would her attitude just ruin her effort in trying to reason with the suspicious?
2/16 22:57:32.787  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: o

2/16 22:58:55.300  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: feels sad, i like the rarity on the item. even if its super duper low
2/16 22:59:02.906  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "You are disturbing. This will only add to the costs and time we need!" *He  pats a pouch.* "We have papers that we can be here, and we report regularly to Greensnow. Now 'git, let us get back to our work."
2/16 22:59:08.841  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: 0.03% is super low yeah, but it better not become like 10%
2/16 22:59:15.900  [4. LookingForGroup] Merkakis-ArgentDawn: fax
2/16 22:59:16.367  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn looks at the three armed men up ahead behind their makeshift barricades.
2/16 22:59:18.228  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: apparently its so low that you'd need 100 horses to drop from headless horseman to match the drop rate of the rocket
2/16 22:59:32.409  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: headless horsaman isnt that rare, but it should be around same rarity i guess
2/16 22:59:36.652  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: since its just a 1 time event each year
2/16 22:59:59.825  [4. LookingForGroup] Ílluminati-ArgentDawn: super low
2/16 23:00:02.325  [4. LookingForGroup] Ílluminati-ArgentDawn: feels bad man
2/16 23:00:05.495  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "I ain't repeating myself again." *The Dwarf growls, putting a hand on his axe.*
2/16 23:00:30.347  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: headless horseman's horse is 0.4% and i just spammed that on 5 alts
2/16 23:00:37.746  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: dude layer 6 was fcking easy

2/16 23:00:40.917  Syruné has gone offline.
2/16 23:00:50.313  [4. LookingForGroup] Ílluminati-ArgentDawn: think im unlucky tho, did it 150x across 10 characters
2/16 23:00:57.265  [4. LookingForGroup] Ílluminati-ArgentDawn: 150 each

2/16 23:01:22.521  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Kappa
2/16 23:01:22.802  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn 's black gaze shifts between Nitzuss and the dwarf. Her expression grows more firm as she looks back at the latter. "And what are you going to do about me not leaving?" 
2/16 23:01:43.176  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: horseman i got np, love rocket is another story
2/16 23:01:50.362  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: ridickerless

2/16 23:03:30.362  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Be a shame if ya fell of the bridge." *Where there first were a few sounds of work going on, that now has died down. You hear a few more clicks and clacks of creatures getting into position, a ragged  human comming to back up the dwarf.*
2/16 23:03:30.671  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: i think the cap is removed yeah, not done torghie in a while though

2/16 23:06:26.965  |Kq18|k whispers: xD
2/16 23:06:39.059  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Just to confirm about tomorrow's invitation, I may have overlapping commitments with a friend who nabbed Mort last weekend. But since the other person RPs more according to their energy levels than on schedule, it might be I'll be able to make it in »
2/16 23:06:39.063  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: » the evening. Aly would deffo come IC 
2/16 23:06:42.566  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: I came to MoP at the last patch so I missed that, sounds dope though

2/16 23:07:47.418  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: got there in time for timeless isle
2/16 23:07:49.629  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: jaina had the right idea. look where we are now
2/16 23:07:53.544  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn 's firm breaks with visible irritation and concern, the sentinel seems conflicted in herself... and more so, struggling to not barge in like a soldier she was!
2/16 23:08:38.698  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: all other endgame zones they added after timeless isle were just copies trying to live on the legend Timeless Isle was
2/16 23:08:42.289  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: but all were massive failures in compare
2/16 23:08:51.022  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn lifts her hand gently as if to soothe the heating situation, "Greensnow and papers, you said. Can we see them?"
2/16 23:08:53.575  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The Dwarf: "We are here ta work. Let us do our job, you do yours. Elsewhere."
2/16 23:08:56.419  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Yup, I mean I want to come but the reason why I can't say for sure yet is because I'm uncertain of how the other RP thing will affect my schedule
2/16 23:09:05.057  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Keil my roof is leaking again
2/16 23:09:24.391  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: you got big storm over in europe too?
2/16 23:09:24.391  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: my flooring is fucking bubbling

2/16 23:09:37.282  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: bubbling? sounds like a feature
2/16 23:10:09.561  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: laminate flooring (i think, i didnt install it been there 10+ years), but if that stuff gets leaks it bubbles, think of a phone protector and air bubbles
2/16 23:10:12.030  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "No, Greensnow is away. Not sure when she returns from her precious refugees."
2/16 23:10:12.878  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: but I never had any leaks so
2/16 23:10:21.829  [4. LookingForGroup] Tarahs-ArgentDawn: It is very cold
2/16 23:10:42.145  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn huffs, trying to release the steam of her fury cooking up; determined something was wrong. Nitzuss's question soothed her for a while, but the dwarf's response seemed to agitate her again.
2/16 23:10:52.358  [4. LookingForGroup] Lushery-ArgentDawn: sounds like damp
2/16 23:11:07.575  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: think so yeah
2/16 23:11:21.737  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (The feeling creeps up to you, that this dwarf ain't going to budge. He knows he has supperiour numbers and the advantage of terrain, as well as the backing of some greensnow? You are not sure what more you can accomplish at this point)
2/16 23:11:24.428  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: do you got those wooden doors in ur house Keil?
2/16 23:11:24.823  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: I run a dehumidifier a lot though so the humidity levels should be fine
2/16 23:11:32.346  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: aye
2/16 23:11:36.879  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: fck those are legit 10/10

2/16 23:12:38.585  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: hard floors absolutely destroy my ankles so slippers are a must

A few more clicking sounds come from the distance, rifles being cocked and aimed. The ragged man stands with the Dwarf in a way that indicates some skill.*

2/16 23:24:48.247  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn exposes her teeth like a saber as the dwarf's demeanor became more threatening. Her fury blinding her from reason or her past words of diplomacy and holding back, she draws her bow and seeks to nock an arrow. "I'm done with your secrecy, dwarf. This is »
2/16 23:24:48.247  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn » our lands and nobody brings harm to it. As long as I live!" Nitzuss would be the only one able to prevent her from acting on the Black Moon's fury.
2/16 23:24:54.443  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: looks like thottbot but i remember diff name maybe im just wrong and getting old

2/16 23:25:12.722  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: KreyGasm
2/16 23:25:30.129  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *You know you need to get her back. You stand no chance here, you will get killed.*
2/16 23:25:35.309  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: not WoWdb, i think it was thottbot i think im just old

2/16 23:26:59.847  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I can feel my legendary item growing inside of me
2/16 23:27:05.355  To |Kq18|k: Though at this rate, they might just end up being part of tomorrow's event as dying captives
2/16 23:27:47.890  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: A Taste of Perfection !? is only on that 18 floor run ?
2/16 23:28:17.975  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: nope

2/16 23:28:31.719  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: hmm
2/16 23:28:38.855  [4. LookingForGroup] Seongseul-ArgentDawn: Did you get over 200 score?
2/16 23:28:39.717  To |Kq18|k: In my mind it was like: Go talk with dude at camp, take closer look at location though still at a distance, then get back.
2/16 23:28:43.267  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn tries to prevent her! She lifts her stave up and attempts to gain the attention of Alyssrea. "Sister, calm! Enough violence and blood has been spilled on this ground."
2/16 23:28:43.844  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: 200 point torghast
2/16 23:28:46.938  [4. LookingForGroup] Seongseul-ArgentDawn: There is also completion and speed.

2/16 23:29:11.396  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: what about the speed ?
2/16 23:29:11.396  To |Kq18|k: Nitzuss stepping up to the play
2/16 23:29:19.484  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: theres a par time for each floor
2/16 23:29:20.127  [4. LookingForGroup] Seongseul-ArgentDawn: Speed is just the overall time you take to clear all floors.
2/16 23:29:20.699  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: speed doesn't matter much
2/16 23:29:23.128  To |Kq18|k: MIhgt still survive

2/16 23:30:11.663  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It could be our kind out there. Harmed by this suspicious folk. I won't allow it!
2/16 23:30:11.894  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: buy the ilvl Boneshatter Vest you want to go up to
2/16 23:30:21.777  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: nothing in between
2/16 23:30:25.733  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i can go from 210 to 262 if i wanted to ?
2/16 23:30:27.838  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: you can go straight to 262 atm
2/16 23:30:28.540  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: yep

2/16 23:31:09.920  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: easy to grind out seeing as torghast is repeatable
2/16 23:31:15.681  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: mind you, there's no NEED for you to have it at 262 really if you don't wanna grind for it
2/16 23:31:17.382  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: forgot about cinders, how many you got atm?
2/16 23:31:17.382  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn is prevented from shooting, or taking aim, but now she was vulnerable to strikes from attacks from the dwarf and the shooters at camp, should they seek to harm her.
2/16 23:31:35.248  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Soul Ash 3870 soul ash and Soul Cinders 570
2/16 23:31:42.859  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: but i legit had 1700 start of the day Soul Ash

2/16 23:32:59.529  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i gotta repeat it cause i dont have enough crystals or something
2/16 23:33:09.497  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn grits her teeth and gives the dwarf and the human an angry stare. "You better have things straight here. Nothing hides from the Goddess's watchful eye."
2/16 23:33:32.531  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: how do i know i did 100% of a floor? not? just hoping?
2/16 23:33:54.036  [4. LookingForGroup] Seongseul-ArgentDawn: You gotta hope. Or be thorough.
2/16 23:33:58.408  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: you just find out at the end and try your best
2/16 23:34:04.439  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: not sure if theres an addon but usually just be methodical and hope lol

2/16 23:34:28.595  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: urns count to that
2/16 23:34:29.364  [4. LookingForGroup] Malmuth-ArgentDawn: use your hunter tracking
2/16 23:34:45.958  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn turns to walk away, watching if Alyssrea would follow.
2/16 23:34:50.457  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: bonus points for not getting hit by any traps
2/16 23:35:03.653  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: damn traps count against you?
2/16 23:35:15.528  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: just get a bonus for going trapless :)
2/16 23:35:15.528  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn seems to find reason in Nitzuss's prior words and follows, although begrudgingly.
2/16 23:35:22.478  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: no minus for getting hit really
2/16 23:35:42.682  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: also, i tend to eat the first broker with the orb he sells for 250

2/16 23:36:05.176  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: its easy to oversee urns jesus
2/16 23:36:07.786  To |Kq18|k: Walking away at the very least.

2/16 23:37:14.241  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: epic powers are too fun, i never skip them
2/16 23:37:19.344  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My apologies for raising my staff. We'd best not commit to blood tonight or we might never find out.
2/16 23:37:28.007  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: i wanna have some fun there while at it :P
2/16 23:37:28.341  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: tbf as hunter i legit find them all useless so far
2/16 23:37:38.141  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: kinda wish blizz spelled this out instead of me wondering why my runs were always 97% or whatever
2/16 23:37:42.374  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: hunters powers in torghast are a mixed bag depending on spec tbh
2/16 23:37:55.174  [4. LookingForGroup] Rhinona-ArgentDawn: hunters get shite anima powers, theres possibly 2 good ones
2/16 23:37:57.074  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: im survival and all of them so far like, mkay this seems like useles sshit
2/16 23:37:59.141  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: if they're good though, i wonder if it's even worth the bonus points skipping them, you'll be more powerful and get bonus points that way
2/16 23:38:01.576  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I feel we are no closer to what afflicted those critters though. They had barricaded no small portion of the ruins.
2/16 23:38:04.374  [4. LookingForGroup] Rhinona-ArgentDawn: resto shammy has the best set by far
2/16 23:38:14.581  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: and yeah, sometimes wow stuff is really cryptic and needs a guide :S
2/16 23:38:24.117  |Kq18|k whispers: If they are wounded, is there even a point to do the ceremony then?
2/16 23:38:30.834  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: yeah shaman has some good stuff, permanent earth elemental with permanent earthquake on it is fun
2/16 23:38:37.706  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: just a broker outside the box that would recount these things would have been nice enough
2/16 23:38:38.864  To |Kq18|k: They are unhurt, luckely
2/16 23:38:46.387  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: what is a brokers traveler point?
2/16 23:38:50.030  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: shaman random totems one is fun af
2/16 23:38:54.365  |Kq18|k whispers: Then we can do the ceremony
2/16 23:38:59.021  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn huffs, slightly calming down. "That whole place reeks of suspicious activities, critters being the least of concern. We should report back so we have the forces to clean this up."
2/16 23:39:00.663  [4. LookingForGroup] Rhinona-ArgentDawn: thats crap compared to storm conduit and bottle of swirling maelstrom lol
2/16 23:39:13.114  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I agree.
2/16 23:39:15.873  [4. LookingForGroup] Rhinona-ArgentDawn: u get those 2 and u need nothing else
2/16 23:39:36.890  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/16 23:39:55.578  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If any innocents have been harmed within the barricades, I won't be held responsible for my further actions. And this Greensnow... has a lot explaining to do.
2/16 23:40:35.466  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do you think it wise to get one last look, from a different vantage?
2/16 23:40:49.180  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: lets hope for 100%
2/16 23:40:54.997  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: 100% first layer bois
2/16 23:40:57.497  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: floor*
2/16 23:40:57.771  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The Elder asked for scouting, that is the least we can get her. 
2/16 23:41:00.314  Alyssrea nods at Nitzuss.
2/16 23:41:36.803  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: PogChampion
2/16 23:41:53.845  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods, "Let's have a look from the beach."
2/16 23:42:09.713  Nifre has gone offline.
2/16 23:42:53.738  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: I genuinely like the fact its 5 floors now
2/16 23:42:56.358  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You spend a little bit of time to overlook the digsite. You manage to make out the different people there, about 6 humans, 1 Gnoll and 3 goblins in total. They do some work, moving rubble but are always close to their weapons you find out.
2/16 23:43:19.830  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: thought so i just kept doing 5, i remember it being 6
2/16 23:43:30.873  [4. LookingForGroup] Lancobi-ArgentDawn: much more manageable, especially if you get a load of crap powers and want to reset if fishing for perfect to farm the 252 conduit upgrade
2/16 23:43:32.559  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: "It's odd. I don't like the look of it."
2/16 23:43:36.360  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: AHAHAHAHA
2/16 23:43:47.022  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I don't know why everyone is making Tessa so frightened tonight
2/16 23:44:04.345  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: That is about as much as you can gather from this point of view, and you suspect that is the most information you can get.
2/16 23:44:09.047  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: This is a DM hint.
2/16 23:44:52.019  |Kq18|k whispers: But honestly, I'm less then pleased. Ceremony would be at 21:30ish. I was fine with delaying it a bit, but i specificly said "Please don't let me wait for hours", it took hours since i said that. My free time is very holy to me. I rushed to get my dinner done, and now I haven't been able to do a thing tonight beside just waiting for a event that was planned cause some last minute scout event »
2/16 23:44:52.554  |Kq18|k whispers: » got pushed in between, even though yesterday it was said we wouldn't do the scouting mission and just start in Darkshore.  It was hard enough to find a proper day to do the ceremony and then its japordized by a mission that could go wrong and delayed it with hours.
2/16 23:45:10.316  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn struggles her strong instinct to not try sniping any of those goblins or the gnoll at the camp. Fuming with fury, the character is blind to DM hints.

2/16 23:46:26.218  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let's make haste. The sooner we do, the sooner this gets resolved.
2/16 23:46:34.464  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods in agreement.
2/16 23:46:38.208  To |Kq18|k: I am just bashing my head against the desk. They are getting back now
2/16 23:46:38.208  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let's ride.
2/16 23:46:41.502  Alyssrea's Starchaser is dismissed.
2/16 23:46:43.530  |Kq18|k whispers: And i adressed it before, please respect other people their time. Make event shorter, don't push till midnight and later. 
2/16 23:48:17.128  To |Kq18|k: [23:11:21] [PL] [60:Arlièn Snowshade]: (The feeling creeps up to you, that this dwarf ain't going to budge. He knows he has supperiour numbers and the advantage of terrain, as well as the backing of some greensnow? You are not sure what more you can acco

2/16 23:52:05.880  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: be loyal to yourself
2/16 23:52:50.055  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whistles a low tune: a song of some sort, but without words is just a little faint wind
2/16 23:52:51.165  Nitzuss bows down graciously.
2/16 23:52:55.536  Alyssrea stands at attention and salutes.
2/16 23:53:04.400  Makhalann-ArgentDawn bows his head to Nitzuss and Alyssrea
2/16 23:53:12.272  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Elune'adore, honored kin. Have you seen Elder Snowshade?
2/16 23:53:36.142  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: where is toto
2/16 23:53:37.125  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune sisters, did the scouting go well?
2/16 23:53:40.860  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: and DONT say africa
2/16 23:53:51.248  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not for a little while. She should return.
2/16 23:53:59.648  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods gently.
2/16 23:54:13.713  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: bruh, you do not want to find toto, their time is over
2/16 23:54:32.339  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: :(
2/16 23:54:55.770  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: saw a vid of one of those guys singing at some event, not even the lead singer, just living on past glory... saddest thing ever x)
2/16 23:55:09.870  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It did. We met with Shadestrike and he reported a misfit crew of workers on the southern end of Auberdine. Me and Sister Whispershot approached them.
2/16 23:55:10.403  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: who toto ?
2/16 23:55:11.150  To |Kq18|k: Should we still get it together?
2/16 23:55:32.584  Makhalann-ArgentDawn listens with attention
2/16 23:55:34.284  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: totoroe but also the band that did that bless the rains in africa song
2/16 23:55:45.617  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: also known as Toto - Africa
2/16 23:55:45.918  Arandell-ArgentDawn folds his arms while listening.
2/16 23:55:47.819  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There had been strange afflictions upon the forestfolk and critters lately.
2/16 23:56:06.233  |Kq18|k whispers: Yes, cause everyone been waiting here and i already wasted my night waiting, atleast let it be worth for something instead of wasting it for nothing at all.
2/16 23:56:19.719  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: A Taste of Perfection dude
2/16 23:56:24.049  Vashíra peers at Nitzuss searchingly.
2/16 23:56:27.434  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Misfit would be understatement defining this crew. They were reported of getting little to nothing done, and were both secretive and hostile upon our approach.
2/16 23:56:27.434  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i didnt need all 100% to get it
2/16 23:56:33.766  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Strange afflictions.
2/16 23:56:34.119  [4. LookingForGroup] Malmuth-ArgentDawn: Gz
2/16 23:56:35.237  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: my score was 211 even though i had 100% 94% 100% 100%
2/16 23:56:35.620  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ?
2/16 23:56:52.078  Nyterian-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Anyone who can brew tea this tasty, is accomplished in my book.
2/16 23:56:55.256  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: ya 200 is 100%
2/16 23:56:55.689  Irrissia-ArgentDawn raises her gaze to stare at Caelir.
2/16 23:56:57.278  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Gz
2/16 23:57:12.750  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Ty
2/16 23:57:15.963  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And crew of what exactly? Horde? Alliance? Murlocs?
2/16 23:57:19.682  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They told us to stay away and take any problems to someone called Greensnow. But this person was said to be away in Stormwind. Creating a dead-end situation.
2/16 23:57:35.700  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mixed group of filth, brother.
2/16 23:57:43.601  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/16 23:57:44.969  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn becomes agitated again.
2/16 23:57:54.246  To |Kq18|k: You can go to the statue, I can get them to go there.
2/16 23:57:55.842  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: did you eat the broker?  :P
2/16 23:58:03.094  To |Kq18|k: Sent em first to the townhall.
2/16 23:58:09.419  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Many, Many Things anyone has this? seems like a forever job
2/16 23:58:11.045  [4. LookingForGroup] Arkaedas-ArgentDawn: i find that's always an easy extra bit of points
2/16 23:58:24.490  To |Kq18|k: Or shall I just wander in, bring Tessa allong with me.
2/16 23:58:33.281  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: I dont have that no
2/16 23:58:37.939  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: not done torghast in a while
2/16 23:58:51.564  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: if i do layer 9 on 1 floor, i can do 9 on all versions it seems?
2/16 23:58:57.383  |Kq18|k whispers: No one knew where you were when they asked were you are, so maybe best you approach us and take them with you to the town hall
2/16 23:59:03.564  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A mix of folk, I counted six humans, one dwarf, one gnoll and three goblins.
2/16 23:59:03.784  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Did Fracture chambers but Coldheart is 9 open now too i see
2/16 23:59:08.100  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goblins, can you imagine?
2/16 23:59:11.865  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: aye
2/16 23:59:37.353  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: damn
2/16 23:59:42.559  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods once.
2/16 23:59:45.268  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Flawless: Fracture Chambers so all of those style achies are RIPE FOR THE PICKING
2/16 23:59:47.061  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goblins are known to travel around, and depending on their tribe they are neutral to the alliance and horde, but gnolls traveling like that..huh.
2/16 23:59:56.920  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They were all armed, yet still moving rubble. Or at least pretending to do so.
2/17 00:00:09.350  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Flawless Master your boy only done one
2/17 00:00:13.290  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] For what I gather, they are clearly hiding something and our people as well as the nature there are in danger. Most of this crew were clinging to their guns instead of doing anything related to rebuilding efforts.
2/17 00:00:20.232  Nitzuss nods at Alyssrea.
2/17 00:00:25.470  Frolbar has gone offline.
2/17 00:00:25.944  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: keil i won this from BMAH today, for just 30k apperently Fleshsmoke Chain Shoulders
2/17 00:00:33.181  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I agree with sister Whispershot.
2/17 00:00:39.098  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums a greeting; "Good fortune."
2/17 00:00:43.294  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: looks nice
2/17 00:00:43.955  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'd suggest we take our own forces---
2/17 00:00:46.726  Makhalann-ArgentDawn gets up, bowing like a solider reporting for duty to Arlien "Elder, my respects"
2/17 00:00:52.905  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: i bid on 2 pets like 10mins ago
2/17 00:00:59.409  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: imagine dropping 30k to get told its nice
2/17 00:00:59.895  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: anything interesting on BMAH?

2/17 00:01:02.617  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn bows her head towards the Elder as she spoke.
2/17 00:01:04.079  Vashíra-ArgentDawn bows her head "Good fortune keeper"
2/17 00:01:09.097  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Arlièn.
2/17 00:01:13.342  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: No worries Aesyla, i will cry in bed later anyways
2/17 00:01:15.282  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: PepeSad
2/17 00:01:19.377  Arandell-ArgentDawn scratches his left ear with his right hand, before bowing his head towards Arlien.
2/17 00:01:21.172  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: nah just 2 pets, a mount we already have, and a cloth i think mog item
2/17 00:01:29.159  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn 's ear twitches and she turns swiftly to face Arlièn, bowing her head.
2/17 00:01:36.839  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: which mount
2/17 00:01:40.009  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Thundering Ruby Cloud Serpent this mount btw 20k on BMAH when i checked
2/17 00:01:44.063  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Jeez
2/17 00:01:45.034  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: A little butterfly comes on over towards you, landing on your shoulder. It mentions a message, that maybe you and Caelir should join Vashira.
2/17 00:01:45.912  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: i paid 12k for rarest pet in the game and im still smug about it Firefly don't think anyone realised how rare it is
2/17 00:01:47.416  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: ow ye we got that already
2/17 00:01:52.589  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Greetings, Keeper.
2/17 00:02:02.434  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Okey, i'm so good
2/17 00:02:04.066  |Kq18|k whispers: Tessa is in the inn
2/17 00:02:05.248  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i wonder how much the x-51 nether rocket was sold a few days ago

2/17 00:02:23.163  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods.
2/17 00:02:25.398  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: dude i was bidding on that fucking rocket

2/17 00:02:30.176  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and beckons Nitzuss and Alyssrea allong.
2/17 00:02:33.723  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: tbh im just keeping my eyes open for 1 mount on the BMAH

2/17 00:03:07.062  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: nah idk
2/17 00:03:13.912  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: within 10mins, it was kicking off >:(
2/17 00:03:14.404  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: whales be like that

2/17 00:03:25.753  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What did Milaelor have to say?
2/17 00:03:31.397  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: yeah
2/17 00:03:46.656  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: but you want to sell it outside AH though, big % cuts
2/17 00:04:05.365  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: i sell one to you for 8mil?
2/17 00:04:14.800  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Wait a minute
2/17 00:04:25.710  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: *Insert that blonde kid meme*
2/17 00:04:41.865  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The forestfolk and critters were suffering strange symptons. Their coat of fur seemed off season and their teeth not properly developed.
2/17 00:04:57.839  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Both the two we saw were scarred.
2/17 00:05:11.760  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "Any idea why?"
2/17 00:05:15.446  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That was the least of problems out there... but the state of critters was most likely related to the suspicious activity at the camp itself.
2/17 00:05:23.002  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: just give me the Deathwing mount that i miss
2/17 00:05:23.392  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods at Alyssrea.
2/17 00:05:28.920  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of what sort?

2/17 00:05:48.881  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/17 00:05:55.646  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i wonder how much it gets sold for
2/17 00:06:22.228  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We took a look from distance to determine our approach, but couldn't see past the barricade. Once we made more direct approach, an armed dwarf in rags blocked our path.
2/17 00:06:40.363  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm, that sounds like something we should investigate further.
2/17 00:07:00.554  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He wouldn't let us in for any reason, claiming it was dangerous. But no proper rebuilding efforts were made. Instead the crew were clinging to their guns and acted hostile.
2/17 00:07:13.354  Arlièn-ArgentDawn frowns and nods.
2/17 00:07:32.721  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How many?
2/17 00:07:39.577  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Sick plotwist, it's always the same flower crown, she just change the color using magic.
2/17 00:07:45.645  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: did you see about players in china getting a spectral tiger mount with 6 month sub
2/17 00:07:52.211  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: dont get me started
2/17 00:07:57.512  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn looks towards Nitzuss, having forgotten about the numbers in her fury.
2/17 00:08:01.913  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: -57 respect.
2/17 00:08:02.278  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: wait really

2/17 00:08:19.229  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (And that's not because I forgot to change the flower crown, n-no.)
2/17 00:08:23.729  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: but only on  TBC classic fyi
2/17 00:08:25.129  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: -99999999 tolerance to arcane use from her.
2/17 00:08:33.872  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Arandell knows it's not true, tbf xD)
2/17 00:08:34.276  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The dwarf plus 10 bodies. I counted 6 humans, 3 goblins and 1 gnoll.
2/17 00:08:38.489  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: still

2/17 00:09:04.789  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Just because the sisterhood accepts arcane, doesn't mean you should be careless with it again...you want another suddering? 
2/17 00:09:08.242  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "You were only two, I hear you. It is good not that you did not engage with them. We will investigate this further come night, with some extra people to aid us."
2/17 00:09:11.445  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: take that back
2/17 00:09:11.922  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And their absent leader. Someone called Greensnow.
2/17 00:09:18.164  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: weird how it was at the same time that a list of banned names about the 2022 beijing olympics dropped kek
2/17 00:09:21.439  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *sundering

2/17 00:09:42.125  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Greensnow? That is curious. We will have to ask around for her.
2/17 00:09:46.467  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: its sad to see how blizz and most big cooperations turn a blind eye when it comes down to China breaking all human rights and free speech
2/17 00:09:48.268  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: just in case of $$
2/17 00:10:01.938  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: China literally has concentration camps

2/17 00:10:11.611  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She was said to be in Stormwind. Not much to oversee what was going on.
2/17 00:10:12.009  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yes but you only OOC complained!

Seeking to protect our kin, the wilds and our world with blade, bow and claw as we »

2/17 00:56:02.111  Irrissia boops Thyreena's nose.

2/17 00:57:22.122  Irrissia-ArgentDawn ears drops and her quiet feathures melt. "Ah...?"
2/17 00:57:26.428  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sister, could you share the further details?
2/17 00:57:27.092  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We are stopping bit too far from the counter for the drinks promised...
2/17 00:57:38.996  Thyreena has gone offline.
2/17 00:57:44.984  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There seems to be some trouble up in Auberdine. A crew of misfits have taken to barricading part of the ruins.
2/17 00:57:59.648  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will need to see to Starchaser.
2/17 00:58:04.310  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn offers Yvaenia a bright smile and inclines her head. "Of course, sister. I have some paperwork I need to attend to myself. May Elune's grace be with you on your watch, sister."
2/17 00:58:05.656  Arlièn-ArgentDawn takes her gloves off, tucking them away behind her belt.
2/17 00:58:07.915  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn aka roleplayer needs to walk dog... brb!
2/17 00:58:29.440  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances towards the counter, before focusing on listening.
2/17 00:58:32.971  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: We did just have her owl spying on us earlier for a little bit of the event.
2/17 00:58:57.865  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Just not Aran's night with anything liquid. :D
2/17 00:59:31.612  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: who? :P

2/17 01:00:16.094  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn gives Yvaenia an amused look. "I will try to not set them on fire, I promise."
2/17 01:00:20.559  Korra stretches and lets loose with a large yawn.
2/17 01:00:26.060  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Tinwetar, as she leaves, running after her.
2/17 01:00:34.928  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Co-...
2/17 01:00:36.162  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A few more of us should be able to handle them.
2/17 01:01:06.273  Irrissia-ArgentDawn blinks a couple of time, surprised by herself, before swallowing and getting a little closer. "I-just..."
2/17 01:01:47.826  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would you like a drink? My treat.

2/17 01:02:57.268  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That sounds like a good way to conclude this night. Come evening we will deal with this problem in Auberdine, we might as well gather in Darkshore itself.
2/17 01:03:21.918  Nitzuss nods at you.
2/17 01:03:22.334  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Did you get my last message?
2/17 01:03:25.533  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Yup
2/17 01:03:30.814  Arandell-ArgentDawn sighs quietly.
2/17 01:03:38.000  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Since the last trip ended so well...
2/17 01:03:48.033  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think that's a good idea.
2/17 01:03:57.252  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Finally a moment for you to get some excercise in again.
2/17 01:03:58.240  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The more the merrier, too.
2/17 01:04:04.496  You smirk slyly at Arandell.
2/17 01:04:51.205  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will tell remember to say that when bunch of us have dark eyes and want to murder everything in sight... again.
2/17 01:05:13.957  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ehm... remember to tell that, I ment.
2/17 01:05:24.755  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You rather go back to Moonglade or a different festival?
2/17 01:05:28.618  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn slides up to the counter on nimble steps and greets Nantar, beaming brightly, "Hey Nan", she says and asks him for a fine moonberry wine.
2/17 01:05:50.631  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Darkshore it is.
2/17 01:05:55.231  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles and nods.
2/17 01:06:07.873  You chuckle at Arandell.
2/17 01:06:15.746  Nitzuss smirks slyly at Arandell.
2/17 01:06:53.180  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn helps pour up five small cups and hands them out.
2/17 01:07:20.860  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Better than Moonglade or pondering if I should jump off the pier with a priestess and elder staring at me.
2/17 01:08:17.886  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Nitzuss as he claims one of the cups.
2/17 01:08:32.936  Arlièn-ArgentDawn accepts a cup from Nitzuss and bows her head in thanks. She raises the cup in a salute and wait for  the others before she would take a sip.

2/17 01:10:36.042  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises the cup towards Nitzuss, waiting for her to drink first.
2/17 01:10:36.828  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn lifts her cup in salute, offering a few words. "To jumping off piers."
2/17 01:10:38.947  Lyndraé has come online.
2/17 01:11:53.540  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To jumping off piers.
2/17 01:11:54.853  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, first time drinking to that. To jumping off the piers.
2/17 01:12:16.496  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums in agreement with Arandell and sips from her wine.
2/17 01:12:34.472  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles and drinks from the cup.
2/17 01:12:42.557  Irrissia-ArgentDawn re-enters the building, before heading straight to Arandell and embrace him on his side, to hide her face in his surcoat. Starts to be a thing.
2/17 01:12:53.448  Korra stretches and lets loose with a large yawn.
2/17 01:13:05.101  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I'm nice, I'm not putting Tessa between arlien and arandell
2/17 01:13:43.291  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn sips her wine and lifts it once more before softly placing it down. She leans idly against the counter, letting out a sigh of relief.
2/17 01:14:23.066  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn looks at Tessaemay, "What was that, sister?", she says and offers her a cup of moonberry wine.
2/17 01:14:34.892  Arandell-ArgentDawn is less alarmed this time by the "assault" only flinches a little, but quite quickly just wraps his metallic hand around Tessa's shoulders with a raised eyebrow while holding on to his cup of wine with the other hand.
2/17 01:14:44.594  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Ah. Therapy dog on duty again!
2/17 01:14:54.360  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: He does it so WELL.
2/17 01:15:11.957  Irrissia-ArgentDawn extends one hand to get the drink, keeping it there for now, needing a moment to recollect.
2/17 01:16:32.403  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks to Tessaemay with some concern, letting  her have some time before asking: "What happened?"
2/17 01:17:30.201  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: supercool :D thx alot for being so welcoming, patient, teaching and all
2/17 01:17:37.056  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: :-)
2/17 01:17:42.905  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head slightly and starts slowly petting Tessa's back. Keeping an eye on his own hands movement while remaining silent and taking a sip from his wine.
2/17 01:17:54.103  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: feel free to drop as many ooc hints and tips as you want. i know it can be a drag but sometimes i might need a nudge.
2/17 01:18:21.770  Irrissia-ArgentDawn eventually releases Arandell, taking a long sip of the moonberries wine. "N-nothing... she just... scared me."
2/17 01:18:50.216  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn tinks her cup to Tessaemay's, taking a sip.
2/17 01:19:14.849  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well the commander can be scary.
2/17 01:20:26.467  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowered her gaze at the cup a short smile on her lips at Nitzuss's action. "Especially when she compliments you..."
2/17 01:20:38.247  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: hehe, ye. That is a thing
2/17 01:20:43.131  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Irrissia.
2/17 01:20:49.638  Arandell-ArgentDawn withdraws his left arm to his side and smiles a bit.
2/17 01:21:02.906  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That may require an explanation.
2/17 01:21:32.471  Irrissia peers at Arandell searchingly.
2/17 01:21:33.909  Lyndraé has gone offline.
2/17 01:22:06.573  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: sometimes i'm a little thickheaded
2/17 01:22:10.999  Thalyndrae has come online.
2/17 01:22:19.523  Irrissia-ArgentDawn babbles. "I- just... apologised for earlier -and- we... we spoke about Ialluen... And then about yesterday and that's... it."
2/17 01:22:20.692  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: but i did want to bail pretty soon after we discovered it
2/17 01:22:38.759  Thalyndrae has gone offline.
2/17 01:23:26.115  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What were you speaking about ?
2/17 01:23:47.112  Irrissia-ArgentDawn takes a sip of her wine, trying to take the disucssion on another topic, as she glances at Nitzuss and Arlien.
2/17 01:23:54.631  [4. LookingForGroup] Vedrak-ArgentDawn: LF warlock to do ritual of doom with in order hall
2/17 01:24:12.355  Arlièn-ArgentDawn drinks a little of her wine.
2/17 01:24:25.555  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of Ialluen as well, actually. And jumping off of piers.
2/17 01:24:32.975  Irrissia peers at you searchingly.
2/17 01:24:35.042  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What ?
2/17 01:24:42.042  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We were just having a toast to good fortune and jum-
2/17 01:24:50.776  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh, what did she wanted earlier ?
2/17 01:25:33.290  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: I just  pinged you a message over Discord. Anything you want to add to it?
2/17 01:26:02.955  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: I am DM, so there may be errors in there, but I won't correct them ;-P
2/17 01:26:13.075  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: aw cmon :P
2/17 01:26:16.315  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly and sips from his wine.
2/17 01:26:29.649  Korra stretches and lets loose with a large yawn.
2/17 01:26:33.666  [4. LookingForGroup] Vedrak-ArgentDawn: LF warlock to do demonic offering with
2/17 01:27:17.878  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Oh and on other topics. Nitzuss seems quite nice pick. Even if I got bit wierd first impression, when she was new and well new to RP, but she seems to have quickly fitted in. :)
2/17 01:27:47.963  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To talk about why I cared about her opinion as much and my unease.
2/17 01:27:59.173  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yup, she learned a lot :-)
2/17 01:28:19.810  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh... That sounds interresting, did it went well ?
2/17 01:29:32.907  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I believe so, but I may be prejudiced.
2/17 01:29:57.168  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm glad to hear.
2/17 01:30:03.936  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Aside conciderations of jumping off the pier, it seemed to end reasonably well. At least nothing gone worse.
2/17 01:30:08.501  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/17 01:30:19.302  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The Commander also said to be carefull in the forest, by the way. To stay by two at least. Or not too far from the settlements.
2/17 01:30:32.834  Irrissia-ArgentDawn quickly looks at her glass of wine after dropping the bomb.
2/17 01:30:43.128  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ugh... well, that sounds familiar.
2/17 01:30:57.803  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: I don't know if that chill down my spine and electric tingling was just because the dwarf charged or if there is more to it.
2/17 01:30:57.824  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: What would you say?
2/17 01:31:10.906  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Loose arcane users and staying in pairs. Better lock up all the talons.
2/17 01:31:38.312  Arlièn-ArgentDawn grumbles something and takes another sip from her dirnk.
2/17 01:31:39.751  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Isn't that more or less the case this time too?
2/17 01:31:57.887  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: Foul play mb. Too late to roll but if anything I might add that - something felt odd from the start.
2/17 01:32:02.995  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters a faint yes.
2/17 01:32:12.180  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: 'An odd sensation when we approached the town'
2/17 01:32:22.443  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: yeah, perfect
2/17 01:32:24.560  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] O-oh, by the way, Arlien...
2/17 01:32:33.913  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Alyssrea, I pinger you amessage over discord
2/17 01:32:37.656  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Can you avoid private discussion with Dathranion for the next ten decades please ?
2/17 01:32:37.955  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn returns after a while of animal companion time, looking around before she orders a glass of moonberry juice.
2/17 01:32:52.989  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: checking ^^
2/17 01:34:45.457  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Did I say too much?
2/17 01:34:54.367  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No ?
2/17 01:34:56.841  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Otherwise Raven will be calling him perv and I have more reasons to punch that smug bastards face.
2/17 01:35:12.902  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn snorts in amusement.
2/17 01:35:52.605  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He did ask to talk. What did he say to you, then?
2/17 01:36:14.290  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/17 01:36:14.722  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn offers Nantar some coins for her drink and looks to her right, smiling in amusement.
2/17 01:36:44.799  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He wanted to get to know you and you were "still" good looking.
2/17 01:36:54.159  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stares at her glass of wine saying so, embarassed.
2/17 01:37:20.417  Squîrrel has come online.
2/17 01:37:22.949  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That was not everything you listed, but suppose it makes the point.
2/17 01:37:45.638  Arlièn-ArgentDawn frowns and takes a sip from her drink.
2/17 01:37:58.175  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I rather not think on that too much.
2/17 01:38:28.808  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles. "Than tell her. It's your mate."
2/17 01:39:11.508  Korra stretches and lets loose with a large yawn.
2/17 01:40:08.401  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let us say the additions made it sound rather dissrespectfull and leave it at that.
2/17 01:41:02.573  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let the highborne dig his own grave of humiliation.
2/17 01:41:03.323  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And you just let him leave?
2/17 01:41:16.649  Arlièn-ArgentDawn sounds more suprised than angry.
2/17 01:41:24.861  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It was during the meeting. I heard about it afterwards.
2/17 01:41:30.783  Arandell-ArgentDawn gestures at Tessa.
2/17 01:41:41.628  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods, emptying her glass.
2/17 01:42:01.639  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perhaps for the best.
2/17 01:42:04.276  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He did apologise and said he was joking...
2/17 01:42:45.572  Arandell-ArgentDawn sighs quietly and peers into his cup.
2/17 01:44:13.606  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn sips the moonberry wine.
2/17 01:44:26.606  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] B-but the meeting went well, on the other hand... The place is perfectly healthy too...
2/17 01:44:48.645  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That at least is some good news.
2/17 01:44:54.407  Irrissia-ArgentDawn cheeks and nose blush progressivly as she drinks her glass.
2/17 01:45:01.815  Nitzuss smiles at Irrissia.
2/17 01:45:32.645  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods, shaking her head and clears her mind. She puts the glass away on the counter, nodding her thanks to Nantar.
2/17 01:46:04.718  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods deeply. "Yes... yes. It's a nice place. I wonder how the plans will look like... Lord Starlight said next meeting, he wanted to show us some of those. But it's still a bit dissapointing he rather orders supplies from Stormwind instead of trying to »
2/17 01:46:05.017  Irrissia-ArgentDawn » reach locals to find what he needs."
2/17 01:47:08.385  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks towards Nitzuss and raises his cup. "Glad you decided to stay." before drinking what remains of the wine and setting the cup on the counter.
2/17 01:47:19.051  Alyssrea peers at Irrissia searchingly.
2/17 01:47:39.520  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Curious, wasn't he just talking about collaboration between the kin by fire?
2/17 01:48:00.851  Korra stretches and lets loose with a large yawn.
2/17 01:48:17.687  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Highborne. Fancy words they can do. Standing behind any of it... well...
2/17 01:49:06.124  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He did, but when we visited the place, he barely mentionned it/
2/17 01:49:16.401  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn raises her cup too, inclining her head to Arandell. "You're not getting rid of me that easy"
2/17 01:49:40.088  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks and dips his head towards Nitzuss.
2/17 01:49:41.351  |Kq12|k whispers: 39 players ? x)
2/17 01:49:43.361  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Fuck, it is almost 2 and I have work tomorrow
2/17 01:49:50.941  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Burned myself just as much
2/17 01:49:55.376  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods firmly. "Can't argue with your sentiment, brother. I have seen worse... a -lot- worse though." she snickers a bit, recalling a moment with a mix of annoyance and amusement.
2/17 01:50:08.809  To |Kq12|k: That would be very tricky, but well....
2/17 01:50:13.133  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Stormwind, you say? I think those ruffians up north might've mentioned they were shipped from there.
2/17 01:50:16.709  To |Kq12|k: I might need some help at that point
2/17 01:50:21.809  |Kq12|k whispers: That's such a random number tho xD
2/17 01:50:29.335  |Kq12|k whispers: And yes, I guess, but so far we are like 10
2/17 01:50:55.646  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would not be suprising the least if there was some connection.
2/17 01:51:02.810  To |Kq12|k: Is it though? I am not counting myself in those 39
2/17 01:51:36.935  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will head on back to the Hermitage, need to see to preperations.
2/17 01:51:52.368  |Kq12|k whispers: Yeah I guess but still
2/17 01:52:05.256  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There was a strange sensation when we came upon the town, almost electrifying. Chilling and tingling at the same time.
2/17 01:52:11.026  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, I better make certain you do as the sentinels wished.
2/17 01:52:12.141  To |Kq12|k: I am not gona juggle two raids ;-P
2/17 01:52:17.227  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles towards Arlien.
2/17 01:52:20.570  Nitzuss bows before you.
2/17 01:52:21.227  |Kq12|k whispers: xDD AH RIGHT
2/17 01:52:30.320  Alyssrea peers at Nitzuss searchingly.
2/17 01:52:34.665  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles fondly to Arandell: "That was my next question."
2/17 01:52:38.479  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I had already forgotten about that little detail.
2/17 01:52:39.222  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I may as well join. I'll need my gear from there.
2/17 01:52:47.376  Nitzuss nods at Alyssrea.
2/17 01:52:58.995  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/17 01:53:06.206  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let's be on our way then.
2/17 01:53:17.366  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Also... someone accompany Tessa.
2/17 01:53:20.930  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thank you for a lovely evening and a great honor, Elder.
2/17 01:53:25.749  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arandell Moonsong.
2/17 01:53:28.667  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Welcome once more, Nitzuss. May our troubles be diminished.
2/17 01:53:28.667  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What ?
2/17 01:53:50.713  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When you head back. Take someone with you.
2/17 01:54:01.629  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Unless you join us.
2/17 01:54:11.457  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The travel in pairs is back in effect.
2/17 01:54:23.690  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I was planning to just... come along ?
2/17 01:54:38.182  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Especially those drinking who rarely do drink.
2/17 01:54:46.897  Irrissia frowns with disappointment at Arandell.
2/17 01:54:48.215  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to the others in farewell.
2/17 01:54:52.196  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm perfectly fine...
2/17 01:54:55.405  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods softly and smiles.
2/17 01:55:03.976  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head.
2/17 01:55:06.619  Irrissia-ArgentDawn respectfully bows her head.
2/17 01:55:06.619  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head. "Goddess watch over you."
2/17 01:55:07.624  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: May Aessina protects you.
2/17 01:55:07.858  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goddess watch over you.
2/17 01:55:08.178  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I am gona bolt, way too late.
2/17 01:55:09.016  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Elune watch over.
2/17 01:55:48.039  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stares past the bridge, tripping on her feet and managing to avoid a shameful fall. Hopefully, no one saw it.
2/17 01:55:50.389  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Time to be pain in the ass to everyone again about the pairs.
2/17 01:56:01.034  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: many thanks for tonight guys :) it's been real fun playing with you all and you've been so great.

2/17 20:10:01.923  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn inclines her head politely, although there is an odd stiffness to her gesture. Perhaps originating from her distrust towards the highborne.
2/17 20:11:03.758  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There is something amiss at those ruins, and it is to us to find out. Go with my blessing and good hunting.

2/17 20:12:10.316  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The path where we were halted lies on the road heading northwest here at the junction.
2/17 20:12:15.653  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Do they have any magical detection amongst them? If not, we can sneak past them.
2/17 20:12:16.416  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: W-wait, you're not comming ?
2/17 20:12:34.962  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They came upon us right as we got on the bridge, so they're likely looking out.

2/17 20:13:00.354  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods.
2/17 20:13:16.146  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will be nearby, but I should see to this. Have faith, in yourself and your brethren they are close as well.
2/17 20:13:22.661  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Could be an alarm device, but that would also be speculation.
2/17 20:13:33.146  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Guide us to the bridge Sisters. But let us stop at a safe distance, so I can see the bridge and decide from there. Unsure about the use of magic, let's keep that as a backup plan for now.
2/17 20:13:34.436  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "But if anyone get injured...?"
2/17 20:13:34.566  Nitzuss bows before you.
2/17 20:13:44.421  Nitzuss nods at Vashíra.
2/17 20:13:49.342  Alyssrea nods at Vashíra.
2/17 20:13:53.507  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They will be in good hands.
2/17 20:13:59.981  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles encouragingly to Irrissia.
2/17 20:14:00.843  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And no Tessa, she aint joining, we are all you get.
2/17 20:14:03.123  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and inclines her head once more, the sentinels waiting impatiently.
2/17 20:14:53.439  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There, up ahead.
2/17 20:14:55.856  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Where were you when the dwarf approached you?
2/17 20:15:10.077  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] On the bridge.
2/17 20:15:12.593  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He stopped us on the bridge. With weapons and attitude.
2/17 20:15:20.623  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You look to Auberdine in the distance. The coastalcity that grew after the Third War has been rebuilt in part after the Cataclysm destroyed it and the Fourth War saw it the site of fierce battle. The smoldering remains of Teldrassil remain in the distance
2/17 20:15:30.859  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Was he like a brigand or did he try to warn you?
2/17 20:15:38.559  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: But there are still areas that have not been rebuilt and are still littered with rubble and the remains of old buildings. The southern end of Auberdine is such a place, where only a few structures have been partially constructed.
2/17 20:15:42.834  Makhalann has come online.
2/17 20:15:46.641  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] His 'warnings' were more like threats.
2/17 20:15:47.158  Iâlluen has gone offline.
2/17 20:15:59.971  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: evening.
2/17 20:16:06.843  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He seemed the rough type. Rugged armor and menacing tone.
2/17 20:16:16.846  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I see, alright, here is the plan.
2/17 20:16:23.830  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He did warn us, said it was none of our business coming here.
2/17 20:16:28.874  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (So to clarify: this is a part of Auberdine, not the whole thing!)
2/17 20:16:36.814  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Evening Mak, want to join in on the event?
2/17 20:16:55.917  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn bares her fangs a bit at the last part.
2/17 20:16:57.104  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: I will go to Winterspring soon, if all goes well
2/17 20:17:06.690  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nitz, and Whispershot, position yourself on the hill across the road, stay out of sight unless we are in danger.
2/17 20:17:09.648  Vashíra points over yonder.
2/17 20:17:14.893  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: for tonight and maybe tomorrow I will be there
2/17 20:17:18.423  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Acknowledged.
2/17 20:17:19.337  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Understood.
2/17 20:17:26.604  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arandell and Dalathria, you do the same over here, stay in cover so you can cover the bridge.
2/17 20:17:31.294  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: From a distance you can make out the scene that Nitzuss and Alyssrea described. A few odd races are working among the rubble, though they are not making much haste.
2/17 20:17:58.083  Yier has gone offline.
2/17 20:17:58.322  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: A shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 20:18:01.796  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 20:18:50.445  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Tessa and Ravensahde, you two will join me. Tessa, I need you diplomacy skills to see if you can get information out of him and let us pass. Ravenshade, while we are there, is there a way for you to detect if there is anyone there who would be able to »
2/17 20:18:52.544  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » spot magic? Incase he won't let us pass we might have to resort to your idea.
2/17 20:19:13.945  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss moves swiftly, ducking across the road an past the brushes up onto the hill overlooking the bridge.*

2/17 20:19:20.578  Lyndraé nods at Vashíra.
2/17 20:19:27.411  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: It's a fairly simple spell, if those are all of them.
2/17 20:19:47.062  Irrissia-ArgentDawn kneads her hands anxiously on her tabard.
2/17 20:19:49.532  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Excellent, let's have a chat with our little friend hm?
2/17 20:19:59.610  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You blink, you look forwards, and you see the past.
2/17 20:20:10.730  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 20:20:22.941  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You step across a border, a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 20:20:37.560  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Or is it the future? You are not sure.
2/17 20:20:46.853  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: perfect :)
2/17 20:20:52.914  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: my bad! mt
2/17 20:20:54.355  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You almost miss it when you step across a border, and a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 20:21:03.017  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *quietly moves up to the tree trunk and finds a place in the bark to support his rifle while keeping himself mostly concealed and crouched.
2/17 20:21:48.189  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Could everyone please make a /roll.
2/17 20:21:54.889  Alyssrea rolls 11 (1-20)
2/17 20:21:56.133  Vashíra rolls 34 (1-100)
2/17 20:21:57.209  Arandell rolls 32 (1-100)
2/17 20:21:58.154  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (20 or 100 ?)
2/17 20:22:01.798  Nitzuss rolls 11 (1-20)
2/17 20:22:02.527  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: is this an issue? I don't want to offend you I talked about this IC yesterday. I will spend a couple of days there with Ivyenna to rp a little travel to vent some steam
2/17 20:22:04.026  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: 100
2/17 20:22:06.918  Alyssrea rolls 89 (1-100)

2/17 20:22:28.306  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: felt like that's cheating
2/17 20:22:44.032  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: No, not at all. It is an invitation, you are free to do as you wish :-)
2/17 20:23:10.069  Lyndraé rolls 28 (1-100)
2/17 20:23:16.617  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: I will follow the campaign on Disc when not able to follow it in game. I will join the next events
2/17 20:23:50.306  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Unlike the night before, there is no dwarf that is comming. A lanky human comes hobbling over, muscled but with a limp. He looks a little dirty. but if it is from work or just his natural state you cannot say.
2/17 20:24:34.065  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Oi, Boss said no visitors. Take it up with Greensnow." *He points in the direction of the huntercamp and then towards Auberdine itself.*
2/17 20:24:57.312  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Awesome :D
2/17 20:25:01.478  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Looks at the human, studying him as he approaches them. She gently says* "Greeting human...Greensnow is your boss?"
2/17 20:25:50.984  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: You do spot the Dwarf however. Off in the distance near the water. You can not hear, but he seems to be cussed out by a Kaldorei.
2/17 20:26:31.100  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *takes out his spyglass and peers through it towards the three ahead and their surroundings.*
2/17 20:26:43.339  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The human spits on the ground beside him:* "No, she hires us. Hammerhost is boss here."
2/17 20:27:59.357  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: You spot a few Humans, a single Gnoll and a goblin or two. There is some commotion near the pier.
2/17 20:28:03.918  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Looks at Tessa and says in Kaldorei* "Can you work your magic here please?"
2/17 20:28:16.143  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Darnassian
2/17 20:28:28.120  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay gaze passes from Vashira to the man, observing him in silence when he speaks. She glances at Vashira, taken aback with her question.*
2/17 20:28:34.660  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Whut?" *The human looks  suspiciously at you lot.*
2/17 20:28:58.257  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay quickly answers to the man.* "She is asking if I know how to speak common. That I do."
2/17 20:29:00.829  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: You also spot 3 goblins, 2 humans and 1 Gnoll.
2/17 20:29:18.044  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: You also spot 3 goblins, 2 humans and 1 Gnoll. There is a little bit of commotion at the building near the water
2/17 20:29:25.426  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal lets her gaze wander from underneath her hood and scryes the area behind the human and the human itself, trying to see if she can find any magically-inclined individuals or divination devices.*
2/17 20:30:34.912  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She glances at Vashira a second, unsure if she must pursues or not.*
2/17 20:31:04.324  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Standing here, you realize you are in the outer ring of a complicated spell work. Lines of subtle magic are at work here. You just crossed a border with significant skill earlier.
2/17 20:31:18.337  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Lets her eyes scan the area, trying to get a number of people present and how they are dressed* "So if we talk to Greensnow we can get a permit to venture on?"
2/17 20:31:23.849  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *slowly adjusts his position near the tree trunk to peer towards the pier bit better through his spyglass*
2/17 20:31:30.932  Elrinde has come online.
2/17 20:31:35.160  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea narrows her eyes, still peering towards the camp from her hiding spot. Bow ready and arrow nocked*
2/17 20:32:33.464  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *As Vashira carries on the discussion, Tessaemay discretly touches her left moonstone on her armor, fuelling a discret spell to scry around, opening herself to the nature and magical signatures around.*
2/17 20:32:37.890  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The Human chuckles a little seemingly amused by the idea:* "Maybe. She said no visitors." *He tries to wave you away, pointing back to the piles of rubble: * "I need to get back to work."
2/17 20:32:45.972  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss lifts one hand and signs with it, counting to 8 on her fingers. She draws an arrow and readies her bow, holding it low.*
2/17 20:33:04.239  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "What are you digging for?"
2/17 20:34:11.662  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *Very little work is being done. The others that seemed to be doing work have put down there tools and look in your direction.* "Clearing rubble, diggin up the past." *He says as though echoing something he heard far to often.*  "Getting rid of the mess."
2/17 20:34:50.820  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "I see, very well, come sisters, let's visit Greensnow"
2/17 20:35:10.985  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: There is a Kaldorei there, learned by the looks of it. He is shouting at a Dwarf.
2/17 20:35:11.674  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal squints her eyes at the human, but she follows Vashira out of there.*
2/17 20:35:23.859  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She swiftly decreases her spell as Vashira and Thalyndrae leave, following quietly.*

2/17 20:35:49.019  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Did you sense anything Ravenshade?
2/17 20:36:16.538  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: female kaldorei, right?
2/17 20:36:37.438  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Whatever we stumbled upon, there is magic radiating all around us; and we were only on the outer edge of a spell. I don't think he meant 'digging up the past' metaphorically, there's some very advanced spellwork going on here."
2/17 20:36:45.933  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: No, man
2/17 20:36:50.872  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *puts his spyglass away and sneaks his way back into the bushes.*
2/17 20:37:15.914  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She nods, approving of Thalyndrae's word.* "It's likely like a large ritual area, I believe..."
2/17 20:37:57.663  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The human, glad to see you leave huffs and returns to pretending to be at work. You do notice people keep an eye on the bridge still.
2/17 20:38:24.745  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: They are playing with forces far beyond their comprehension, this has to be put to a stop.
2/17 20:38:38.367  Vashíra-ArgentDawn nods a little
2/17 20:38:47.584  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Male kaldorei at the pier. Think he is scolding a dwarf. Looked bit fancy.
2/17 20:39:21.683  Nitzuss nods at Arandell.
2/17 20:39:30.603  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The human refered to Greensnow as a she
2/17 20:39:35.117  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The samel goblins, humans and gnoll were near the buildings as well. Not seeming to do anything remarkably important.
2/17 20:39:59.076  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thoug he did mention their boss was someone called Hammerhost....that must be the dwarf i reckon with such a name?
2/17 20:40:23.261  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Did not look like he was outranking the kaldorei.
2/17 20:40:27.092  Yier has gone offline.
2/17 20:41:36.708  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So let's have a look hm? The three of us will go into Auberdine, as before, I need the four of you to cover us
2/17 20:41:47.153  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: *Shooting an occational glance towards the others, Dalathria remains in the bushes. With her bow ready she keeps eyeing the bridge and beyond.*
2/17 20:41:48.211  Yier has come online.
2/17 20:41:53.724  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles faintly. "Even if we get the permission to pass... They won't let us have a look..."
2/17 20:42:09.585  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Only now realising auberdine is at the otherside of the bridge >><
2/17 20:42:28.190  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes. Was bit confused there. :P
2/17 20:42:42.815  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Only the Goddess may forbid us from walking on our own lands.
2/17 20:42:45.819  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: I got confused as i was told to talk to greensnow but apparantly not allowed to go there xD
2/17 20:42:58.445  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (This is not Auberdine as a whole, we have an 'instanced part of it')
2/17 20:43:23.212  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The real auberdine being bigger than the representation ingame
2/17 20:43:31.216  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: (Im getting a bit confused now, is there a part of Auberdine on this side as well?)
2/17 20:43:43.364  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: (That the man pointed too? So i know where to go?)
2/17 20:44:12.028  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (I assume the town is just larger than it is in game. Picture larger proportions, more buildings etc?)
2/17 20:44:15.911  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: I doubt they'll think the same. Yesterday they were quick to hostility.
2/17 20:44:25.936  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss says*
2/17 20:44:53.431  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (The man pointed north, to a rebuild part of Auberdine. If you want to go there, we take a little walk and then pretend to get there)
2/17 20:45:39.950  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (NL's greatest weakness: orientation)
2/17 20:45:55.638  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Oh my. Won't even dare say anything about that.)
2/17 20:46:18.868  Alyssrea points over yonder.
2/17 20:46:19.843  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You are still close to the border of the spell, almost on top of the boundary. You notice it comes alive, it flares and something is happening.
2/17 20:46:23.066  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You are still close to the border of the spell, almost on top of the boundary. You notice it comes alive, it flares and something is happening.
2/17 20:46:31.494  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: ...something is going on.
2/17 20:46:37.994  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks down and up, and back at the bridge.
2/17 20:46:44.723  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (north is where Arlien's tail is pointing at)
2/17 20:46:47.053  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: ...They started channeling.
2/17 20:47:00.604  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn quirks an eyebrow.
2/17 20:47:20.119  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So either we investigate with force or head to northern part of Auberdine?
2/17 20:47:35.022  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Vashira. "Let me have a look from the sky. Maybe there is a way to... avoid fighting ?"
2/17 20:47:54.281  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] In any case, we should make haste. Or I will rush in regardless of outcomes.
2/17 20:47:54.698  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Just be careful Tessa. 
2/17 20:47:57.605  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Vashira Ravenheart.
2/17 20:48:46.684  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay takes a few step away from the main group, disappearing behind the hill, to shapeshift in her butterfly form.

2/17 20:52:27.657  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So about eight people in total
2/17 20:52:39.906  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: There is another bridge, further on our right.
2/17 20:52:48.880  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Or a pass through the river on our left.
2/17 20:53:00.879  [4. LookingForGroup] Wagumag-ArgentDawn: 7
2/17 20:53:01.850  [4. LookingForGroup] Wagumag-ArgentDawn: ¨
2/17 20:53:04.609  [4. LookingForGroup] Wagumag-ArgentDawn: LF friends
2/17 20:53:09.497  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How wild is the river to the left?
2/17 20:53:20.641  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Calm enough to cross it without too many trouble.
2/17 20:53:30.631  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Any cover to go around the place from there?
2/17 20:53:50.254  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: We should climb back behind a house, but it's not the best.
2/17 20:54:02.373  [4. LookingForGroup] Ílluminati-ArgentDawn: don't
2/17 20:54:03.290  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: But that's the closest from... the two gobelins.
2/17 20:54:06.999  [4. LookingForGroup] Propke-ArgentDawn: not gonna happen on wow :p
2/17 20:54:07.889  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And the right side, anyone there, can we cross that bridge without trouble you think?
2/17 20:54:25.940  [4. LookingForGroup] Ílluminati-ArgentDawn: not here, not irl, just be happy on your own
2/17 20:54:28.545  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: They were discussing around a paper... And no one around the other bridge that I saw.
2/17 20:54:42.603  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let us take the bridge
2/17 20:54:50.935  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly.
2/17 20:54:55.979  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Show the way Tessa
2/17 20:55:12.069  Alyssrea's Starchaser is dismissed.
2/17 20:55:25.439  [4. LookingForGroup] Wagumag-ArgentDawn: whatr do you guys usualtyt do on mmorpgs
2/17 20:55:35.520  Alyssrea receives loot: Rusted Mining Pick.
2/17 20:56:00.962  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: This part gives a little bit of cover to approach, some ruined buildings blocking their sight. Some even have been rebuild, waiting to be occupied again
2/17 20:56:22.747  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I don't suppose you were able to see any runes from up there?
2/17 20:56:26.274  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: They were digging holes everywhere too... It didn't make any sense up there.
2/17 20:56:33.093  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head at Thalyndrae Ravenshade.
2/17 20:56:54.941  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: (Auw, my tail)
2/17 20:57:22.426  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: (ooof, them stealthy kittens just lying around. :D)
2/17 20:57:24.321  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: They must have found something, an artifact; this much power couldn't have come from just a couple of spellcasters...
2/17 20:57:41.220  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arandell, Dalathria, with me, we will cross the bridge, see if it's safe to cross. Tessa and Ravenshade, stay here till we give the signal, then have Nitz and Whispershot join us.
2/17 20:57:43.163  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods, a growing discomfort showing on her feathures.
2/17 20:57:47.906  Lyndraé nods at Vashíra.
2/17 20:57:50.501  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Vashira Ravenheart.
2/17 20:58:23.345  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (Your DM was confused and thought you mean the other bridge.)
2/17 20:58:32.972  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: This part you cross easily.
2/17 20:58:59.220  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Waves at Tessa to join up again*
2/17 20:59:00.460  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (we are just extra careful)
2/17 20:59:30.974  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (3 hours later we cross a bridge...)
2/17 20:59:43.244  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (You are rewarded by way of the bridge not blowing up)
2/17 20:59:45.367  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: (^^)
2/17 20:59:49.456  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Nitz, Whisper, take the front and lead us in, Arandell and Dalathrai cover our rear
2/17 21:00:00.322  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/17 21:00:03.440  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You are now outside the circle.
2/17 21:00:04.184  Nitzuss nods at Vashíra.
2/17 21:00:09.849  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You are now outside the circle.
2/17 21:00:21.037  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Ravenshade, if you sense anything, let me know at once okay?"
2/17 21:00:25.017  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay seems to phase for a second, before following*
2/17 21:00:30.339  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Were for a little while
2/17 21:00:32.441  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Were for a little while
2/17 21:00:44.784  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 21:00:47.895  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 21:00:56.782  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Will do."
2/17 21:00:58.245  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* Did you feel that?
2/17 21:01:02.910  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: ((SOrry for the delay, I really had a hard time visualizing the scene))
2/17 21:01:08.969  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss maintains a watchful eye on both her flanks*
2/17 21:01:11.526  To Vashíra-ArgentDawn: a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 21:01:11.772  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "We are outside of the circle..."
2/17 21:01:13.928  To Dalathria-ArgentDawn: a shiver runs down your spine.
2/17 21:01:17.752  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: -Were-.
2/17 21:01:24.187  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: We continue.
2/17 21:01:28.705  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn looks around.
2/17 21:01:32.525  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You are right on the edge of the spell. This seems to be an anchorpoint.
2/17 21:01:32.783  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "This feels very bad"
2/17 21:01:40.999  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You are right on the edge of the spell. This seems to be an anchorpoint.
2/17 21:01:41.900  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: Like, where we are?
2/17 21:01:57.535  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: They have anchor points all around.
2/17 21:02:00.129  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Yes
2/17 21:02:06.375  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To what purpose?
2/17 21:02:08.237  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay is focusing more on the spell than anything else, and she alsmost trips on her feet.*
2/17 21:02:24.542  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: We'll probably find out there.
2/17 21:02:28.354  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn points to {Cross}.
2/17 21:02:30.834  Vashíra-ArgentDawn whispers: What is there at the purple icon?
2/17 21:02:38.662  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss scouts the area ahead, looking for the bridge and any activity around it*
2/17 21:02:45.296  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (How is the nature reacting to that, btw ? Because it's just arcanic so far, right ?)
2/17 21:03:22.598  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The {diamond } building at end of the road has a number of boxes and barrels stacked up neatly.
2/17 21:04:09.134  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Looking to the little critters here, you do notice something amiss. They are shedding fur as though loosing their wintercoat, but the colours are that of late summer.
2/17 21:04:15.688  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] "Let's have a look yes"
2/17 21:04:20.561  Iâlluen has come online.
2/17 21:04:32.543  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] "But first we need to find a way there"
2/17 21:04:35.561  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You're careful approach has not allerted the ruffians.
2/17 21:05:03.874  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: I can't see much from here. There's a building down the road with some barrels and boxes.
2/17 21:05:04.319  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nitz, how many did you see from here and where?
2/17 21:05:09.790  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah
2/17 21:05:10.280  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay squints at a fleeing squirrel, going after the critter as it climbs on a tree, phasing on it fur.*
2/17 21:05:15.941  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let's go to that building first
2/17 21:05:19.087  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods.
2/17 21:05:37.428  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Lead the way Nitz
2/17 21:05:38.574  Vashíra smiles.
2/17 21:06:24.391  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Loosing their wintercoat, but fur in summer color...
2/17 21:06:27.970  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arandell, Dalathria, can you setup here
2/17 21:06:37.655  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To guard the bridge?
2/17 21:06:46.736  To Dalathria-ArgentDawn: From your position in the back, you notice how some of the {square} Humans are looking in your direction
2/17 21:06:49.754  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Make sure no crosses the bridge while we look at the crates for amoment
2/17 21:06:53.144  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Thalyndrae Ravenshade.
2/17 21:07:09.279  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Walking up on nimble and stealthy steps, Nitzuss tries to get a closer look on the barrels and boxes stacked together.*
2/17 21:07:24.450  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: The boxes are interesting, but there is something arcane here too. Your senses more honed than that of Tessa notice it a little further up in the building.
2/17 21:07:25.050  Irrissia-ArgentDawn turns to look at the center point of the spell work, clearly constantly disctracted by its signature.
2/17 21:07:42.987  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Looks at the water, trying to see if it would be crossable*
2/17 21:07:49.819  Vashíra kneels down.
2/17 21:07:55.219  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Give me a moment...
2/17 21:08:13.824  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn joins Nitzuss to study the boxes.
2/17 21:08:15.439  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thalyndrae tries to venture further in the building and glance at the boxes, her eyes glimmering brightly as she scans it, trying to see what peaked her senses.*
2/17 21:08:22.852  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The boxes and barrels are sealed shut, marked with a snowplow and the equal illustrious name "Snowplow Cartel."
2/17 21:08:54.209  Irrissia-ArgentDawn eventually moves to some cover.
2/17 21:09:16.283  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *drops on one knee and lowers his rifle on the rocks in front of him, before finding his spyglass and taking a quick look around in the general area beyond the bridge and bit further, in case no on is close to the bridge in front.*
2/17 21:09:21.346  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Snowplow Cartel...? The goblins have such nerve..!
2/17 21:09:39.734  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You notice the spell is starting to act up again, a sensation from the center from the town. You are just out of sight to make out what is happening.
2/17 21:10:24.000  Irrissia-ArgentDawn raises her eyes from the ground, cancelling whatever she had in mind. She squints, and takes up to the sky quickly. Maybe reacting fast enough to catch what's messing with the spell.
2/17 21:10:39.597  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: There is a cleared spot, just a little further in. The spell begins to weave and bob in fascinating and familiar ways. Your eyes pierce an illusion and in a cleared circle lies a red gem.
2/17 21:11:03.459  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Snowplow. That's Everlook goblins, same as from Felwood.
2/17 21:11:12.599  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn frowns deeply.
2/17 21:11:13.585  Alyssrea raises her eyebrow inquisitively at Nitzuss.
2/17 21:11:18.779  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Felwood, sister?
2/17 21:11:23.529  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: There is a gem here, possibly a conduit or anchor for the spell.
2/17 21:11:40.366  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Magic crackles and lashes out. There is a blue flash that quickly turns to bronze. A smell of ozone permeates the air and a few boxes tumble near the building tumble.
2/17 21:11:54.646  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *glances towards Vashira and then peers through the spyglass towards the building pointed to him, near {red} for any people around, or what one can see, in it.*
2/17 21:12:55.814  Changed Channel: |Hchannel:1857460016|h[(null)]|h
2/17 21:13:34.493  Arlièn has invited you to join a group.
2/17 21:13:37.614  Party converted to Raid
2/17 21:13:37.614  You have joined a raid group. 
2/17 21:13:37.614  Raid Difficulty set to Normal.
2/17 21:13:37.614  Legacy Raid Difficulty set to 25 Player.
2/17 21:13:44.221  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: "For Goddess's sake... What is... NO!" *feels the darkness swallow her whole*
2/17 21:13:56.039  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Dal, what happened? Where are the others?"
2/17 21:14:05.106  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Oh, not again..."
2/17 21:14:24.906  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You blink your eyes and light returns to you and you see Auberdine. But what you first see is Teldrassil. It is towering up in all its glory, it’s leaves waving in the wind and you can see lights glow on the branches.
2/17 21:14:47.216  Nitzuss waves at you.
2/17 21:14:51.450  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: "Haven't got the faintest clue... Aran is still with us? Anyone else?"
2/17 21:15:29.716  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Please switch to party chat ;-)
2/17 21:15:32.152  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Yeah, he is right over there"
2/17 21:15:33.584  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: oki
2/17 21:15:49.749  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It is as it was before the War of Thorns.
2/17 21:16:00.437  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (So still destroyed?)
2/17 21:16:01.305  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Either in a very foolish, or very brave attempt, Tessaemay try to flap closer and lands on the roof to get a better view of what the gobelins are doing. She is a butterfly. Who's gonna suspect her, anyway ?*
2/17 21:16:20.338  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *looks around briefly but then decides to keep an eye on the bridge in case someone else noticed the flash and magic as well*
2/17 21:16:23.072  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea takes a while to get back on her feet, seeming to feel sick from what just happened* "What foul manner of tricks are these? Where are we..? Why..." *her eyes widen as she sees Teldrassil tower above the shores once more* "This cannot be...!"
2/17 21:16:25.337  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Also, my alt is next to you. Auberdine is indeed destroyed after the Cataclysm.
2/17 21:16:37.637  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Arandell, do you see anything? Did you see the others?"
2/17 21:17:15.005  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal takes a long look at Teldrassil and lets out a sigh before looking around. "Right... Auberdine is still destroyed, but Teldrassil still stands. There's about a five year period when this could have happened. Small effect, however; the spell must not
2/17 21:17:17.703  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: be done yet."
2/17 21:17:23.770  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: "No. Just the flash and that is it. Not seeing anything else yet."
2/17 21:17:49.387  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss comes to, holding her arms up to guard herself before realizing she's on balanced ground.*"What in the wo-"* she begins, but suddently stops as her eyes fall upon the world tree, speechless*
2/17 21:18:19.419  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Nitzuss, Alyssrea and Thalyndrae are gone.
2/17 21:18:22.019  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "I'll have a look with Dal"
2/17 21:18:51.452  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Let's have a peek inside, but stay away from the crates okay?"
2/17 21:19:26.853  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *grumbles and mumbles but keeps his eyes towards the bridge and eventually starts scanning the area again with his spyglass*
2/17 21:19:28.120  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea grows increasingly distressed, her distrust towards magics growing significantly with what just happened. Her eyes start to shift in color and retaining their original silver color.. so goes with the added brashness to her personality as well*
2/17 21:20:02.420  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Glancing at Thalyndrae, Nitzuss asks,*"What happened?"*, letting her eyes wander across Auberdine searching the area for any activity.*
2/17 21:20:15.452  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: *Dalathria nods, her expression looking rather grim. Still holding onto her bow she gets up.
2/17 21:20:22.286  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *This version of Auberdine is empty, but you can hear two people speaking on the beach.*
2/17 21:21:05.885  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Peers inside the building, look for fallen crates or any sign of the others without entering the building*
2/17 21:21:08.287  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Either an illusion or we were sent back in time. In either case, we need to stick together. We can't have us marooned in different times, alone. There has to be a way to get us back..." *Thal says as she starts scrying around the place for any anchor 
2/17 21:21:12.919  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: point which she could use to get back.*
2/17 21:22:05.153  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss' eyes focus immidiately towards the sound of chatter. She crouches low and motions for her allies to do the same*
2/17 21:22:27.219  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The building is much the same. A few of the boxes have tumbled and one cracked open. It shows looted horde weapons. There is a faint scorch mark, but no sight of your companions
2/17 21:22:46.218  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *the apparent reality of the situation starts dawning to Aly as Thal speaks* "So... Our people, families.. friends... They all still endure?" *she beams her gaze back to the shore and beach* "They could be brought back?"
2/17 21:23:09.251  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *lowers his spyglass and looks towards Vashira and Dalathria, with a lowered voice he says "They have not noticed us."*
2/17 21:23:11.384  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Dal...do you think they been blasted?" *She looks a bit confused at the faint scorch mark*
2/17 21:23:59.419  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "The ones that died in Teldrassil? No. They're dead, only living as a glimmer in the past. As much as you're tempted to help them, warn them or what would you, we shouldn't interfere in any way."
2/17 21:24:05.918  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *With gentle steps, Nitzuss start making her way closer to the two voices, trying to discern what they are saying*
2/17 21:24:44.938  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: "The building still stands. I have a hard time believing that they would've been reduced to dust without destroying the whole thing."

2/17 21:33:29.694  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn brings her hand to her chest and squeezes her fingers together. She looks down, grimacing and then looks back towards the kin on the shore. "Elune'adore... brother... sister." her voice, although attempted to be kept balanced and proper, cracks with »

2/17 21:38:20.108  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn struggles to contain herself, for a fleeting moment one could see glimpse of that sentinel Alyssrea was between fall of Teldrassil and receiving black moon's blessing, the survivior's guilt conflicting with her training to maintain cool in any »

2/17 22:13:14.778  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: "Be swift about it." *Alyssrea, too confused in being back in time, wouldn't resist use of magic as much as often. More magic in a problem caused by magic... but her tone suggested she wasn't keen about it either*

2/17 22:18:46.114  Aetherion yells: I SEE YOU, INSECT. RUN WHILE YOU CAN. RUN AND TELL YOUR PATHETIC LOR'DANEL THAT I AM COMING TO DESTROY IT!

2/17 22:22:05.073  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Are we really gonna play that game? You did just see what we did hm?" she looks at Arandell, see if he could poke the blade at the dwarf a bit.
2/17 22:22:42.373  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessamay pocketed the books in her bags before joining the other back.*

2/17 22:22:50.073  Archaeologist Hollee yells: I am an archaeologist with the Explorers' League! I can assure you that King Magni will hear of this outrage!
2/17 22:23:07.940  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The man nods grimly to Alyssrae. "Dark times. We must rebuild!"
2/17 22:23:28.806  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn speaks in a low voice, "That's the same man who was scolding the dwarf."
2/17 22:23:39.740  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "I swear I know nothing of your friends!" The dwarf squirms.

2/17 22:25:59.728  Archaeologist Hollee yells: I am an archaeologist with the Explorers' League! I can assure you that King Magni will hear of this outrage!
2/17 22:26:49.216  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "Well, now, that's also our business. Do you calculate where the jewel is suppose to be placed to use the magical circle ?"
2/17 22:26:51.282  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: And a good thing you do, because as the man jumps over he begins to slide down. He looses his grip and is in the process of falling. Bound by arcane bindings he now dangles over the edge
2/17 22:27:03.895  You have requested to trade with Lyndraé.

2/17 23:24:27.475  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Please! Someone! Anyone! Help me get out of here!
2/17 23:24:42.609  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She breathes deeply, clearly emotional. Her roots spell suffer from her own unstability, the gobelin can easily free herself at that point, the vine looely hanging around her.* "Thalyndrae...?"

2/17 23:25:18.975  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The gal quickly jumps up, though she does not think of running. The gal looks around and swallows hard.
2/17 23:25:21.275  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: "Wait...what?"
2/17 23:25:42.376  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss keeps a close watch on the man, presumably Winterflower. She keeps him within an arm's length, looking for any signs of sudden rebelliousness.*

2/17 23:25:58.376  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: *Tosses a look at the female goblin* "I would advice against running, or our sister over there will shoot a arrow trough your knee"
2/17 23:26:00.009  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *turns to look at the female. "Good, just stand still."*
2/17 23:26:21.442  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Ah, bloody fel, nevermind... we must bring them this gem, not theirs. Right, hmm...
2/17 23:26:21.442  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Yes, yes, yes, whatever you want
2/17 23:27:55.608  Archaeologist Hollee yells: You cultists are going to pay! Someone get me out of here!
2/17 23:28:35.675  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Right... we must get this gem to the present...
2/17 23:28:53.575  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But how? We are still trapped here.
2/17 23:29:09.909  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: The same way you always leave things for the future. You bury them.
2/17 23:29:10.143  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: ((I fear my time to quit for the night has come, it's getting pretty late for me))
2/17 23:29:17.108  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Come to the top of the inn! They have me chained up!
2/17 23:29:29.375  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: He is just keeping silent at the moment. He smirks at the mention of being trapped. He looks to the canister at the belt.
2/17 23:29:34.774  Alyssrea shrugs at Lyndraé. Who knows?
2/17 23:29:48.041  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ((Awwwh.))
2/17 23:29:56.075  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal notices the look of the Highborne and tries to take the canister from him and place the gem inside.*
2/17 23:29:56.942  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: ((Thank you for being with us, I hope you enjoyed still :-) ))
2/17 23:30:27.542  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: ((Sorry it was so long, we're dumb lol))
2/17 23:30:32.875  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The mage frowns a lilttle, taken aback.
2/17 23:30:36.376  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea looks increasingly confused, having little knowledge of how magic worked like that. She dedices to just follow along and keep an eye on the highborne*
2/17 23:30:36.975  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: ((Gnight Vash, glhf tomorrow :))

2/17 23:31:08.342  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ((I mean, we are still waiting on them to answer :p Slow is the word.)
2/17 23:31:16.441  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Hey! Anybody out there?
2/17 23:31:28.476  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (Oh yes. Fair enough. It takes a long time for them to say "yes." :P)
2/17 23:31:34.676  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal tries to bury the canister in front of the Moonwell.*
2/17 23:31:43.342  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss narrows her eyes, puzzled, following the man's gaze and inspecting the canister at the belt as well*
2/17 23:31:43.908  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (I didnt see it shit)
2/17 23:31:47.975  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You succeed at that
2/17 23:32:18.341  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (that said. 2 mins afk.)
2/17 23:32:23.143  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: ((IT was nice thank you! Sorry that i can't stay till the end, have fun! Won't be here the next few nights..or maybe I am..massive storm expected tomorrow, not sure if work sitll happens due to safety hazzards))
2/17 23:32:28.110  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal then speaks to the crystal. "Yes, Tessa, it's me. Now, I need you to listen carefully. In front of the Moonwell, there's an urn buried with a crystal inside. Take the crystal and place it where it's supposed to be placed."
2/17 23:32:42.774  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Somebody please! Get me out of here before they sacrifice me!
2/17 23:33:01.575  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: ((Goodnight all!))
2/17 23:33:06.542  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The crystal replies: "Yes, Tessa, it's me. Now, I need you to listen carefully. In front of the Moonwell, there's an urn buried with a crystal inside. Take the crystal and place it where it's supposed to be placed."
2/17 23:34:20.875  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay seems to have some troubles to process the information, or react, but after a moment, she looks up at Arandell, and then around, for the said moonwell.*
2/17 23:34:28.544  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Need some help here! Damsel in distress! <snort>
2/17 23:35:21.275  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Now let's hope they find it...
2/17 23:35:27.041  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: In the meantime... well, there's nothing else for us to do.
2/17 23:35:28.541  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (back)
2/17 23:35:34.008  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She moves closer to {square} and studies the place, at this point, completly sidetracked.* "An urn..." *She mumbles under her breath*
2/17 23:35:36.942  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal does one last scan of the environment for any leftover temporal auras.*
2/17 23:35:38.042  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Though there is no more moonwell, there are still the remnants of some rubbble at {blue}
2/17 23:36:14.341  Archaeologist Hollee yells: You cultists are going to pay! Someone get me out of here!
2/17 23:36:16.707  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: "Do we need to dig, Tessa?"
2/17 23:37:22.541  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn sits down by the moonwell, enjoying the look of Teldrassil one last time.
2/17 23:37:27.275  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Using the roots on her glove, she manages to dip up the urn burried here.* "No, I got it, Arandell..."
2/17 23:37:50.875  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Enjoy the view, sisters, you won't see it again, probably.
2/17 23:37:58.808  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She mumbles in the crystal* "And now ? I put the crystal inside ? Or...?"
2/17 23:37:59.508  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There is more disruption here, but you reckon with the removal of the gemstone in the well it will fade quickly enough.
2/17 23:38:07.041  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn crosses her fingers and mumbles a quiet prayer to the Goddess. The evening had confused the sentinel more than she had realised but she sought to keep tough front until the end of it. She seemed more resistant to look around now than previously, as if »
2/17 23:38:07.374  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn » to not poke those memories.
2/17 23:38:12.341  Archaeologist Hollee yells: You cultists are going to pay! Someone get me out of here!
2/17 23:38:56.477  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Tessa mumbles in the crystal* "And now ? I put the crystal inside ? Or...?"
2/17 23:39:02.923  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (yo, you nonexistent druid - move out of my screenshot)
2/17 23:39:09.674  You are no longer Away.
2/17 23:39:14.318  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal speaks in the crystal. "Inside what? What did you find?"*
2/17 23:39:15.675  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Up here on the second floor of the inn! Hurry!
2/17 23:39:28.836  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods, taking heed of her sisters words and turning to watch the world tree once more. She stands in silence impressed by its looming canopies covering the skies.
2/17 23:39:33.203  Alyssrea receives loot: Shimmering Shards.
2/17 23:39:35.070  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: "Very well." *makes few glances towards Tessa while mainly keeping an eye on the two goblins still, but slightly pointing the rifle downwards.*
2/17 23:39:54.070  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Thalyndrae speaks from the crystal: "Inside what? What did you find?"*
2/17 23:40:10.036  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She speaks back* "A gem, red, with bronze engravings."
2/17 23:40:10.036  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (You may respond to her in raid when she pokes you.)
2/17 23:40:36.703  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (oki)
2/17 23:40:52.870  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Okay, good... Bring it back to where we disturbed it, in the building, near the boxes."
2/17 23:41:11.237  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Need some help here! Damsel in distress! <snort>
2/17 23:41:27.066  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She nods, even if Thalyndrae can't see it and heads in that direction, shooting for Arandell and Dalathria -still holding the crystal-* "Won't be long !"
2/17 23:42:10.365  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (screenshots done)
2/17 23:42:24.155  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Hey! Anybody out there?
2/17 23:42:29.939  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Blesssed -for once- with her flawless memory, Tessaemay replaces the gem where it was suppose to be, slightly moving it to be in the exact position then before.*
2/17 23:42:46.872  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (should have removed that one before)
2/17 23:43:21.939  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The spell begins to twist and turn, a tension builds up in the air. With the components back in place mana begins to flow once more.*
2/17 23:43:27.505  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Hey! Anybody out there?
2/17 23:43:50.539  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She quickly moves away, in case people reappears where they disappeared.*
2/17 23:43:53.106  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (that marker on the roof was more difficult to rule out)
2/17 23:43:56.620  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: When you're done, sisters...
2/17 23:44:34.455  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Need some help here! Damsel in distress! <snort>
2/17 23:44:50.523  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The glass orb in the center of the well turns and twists, rotating around its axis. Flashing energy in bronze colour sparks.
2/17 23:44:56.422  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn touches the crescent of her coif and mutters a few words to herself solemnly before turning away from Teldrassil.
2/17 23:45:53.192  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Come to the top of the inn! They have me chained up!
2/17 23:46:05.801  Alyssrea receives loot: Crackling Crystals.
2/17 23:47:18.273  Archaeologist Hollee yells: Hey! Anybody out there?
2/17 23:47:20.473  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "Let us..."
2/17 23:47:25.142  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal gets to the orb and tries using it to create a temporal portal to the other side, a visible rip in the fabric of space time visible with the future on the other side. "After you."*
2/17 23:48:41.641  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: 'Nitzuss nods at Thalyndrae slowly, eyeing the twists and rips of reality with wide eyes. She steps forward slowly*
2/17 23:48:42.440  Archaeologist Hollee yells: You cultists are going to pay! Someone get me out of here!
2/17 23:48:43.841  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: A portal opens up at the site of the former well, sparks of bronze energy eminating from it.
2/17 23:48:57.507  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea steps forward and reaches towards the portal with an extended hand before she would step through*
2/17 23:49:04.607  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You may return to the present time, get back to {blue}
2/17 23:49:43.574  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal finally steps through, taking the orb with her and closign the portal behind her like you would sow a blouse.*

, perfect... would you be a dear and drop the crystal where it's supposed to be placed? Try the Moonwell near the inn."
2/17 23:22:18.099  Irrissia-ArgentDawn hiccups in surprise, escaping the gem. She lowers to recover it, clearly stressed by the answer she got.
2/17 23:22:20.286  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Keileel, you think

2/18 00:10:15.699  Nifre has gone offline.
2/18 00:10:18.833  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: because we were with 2 people, it didnt register me going left and right cause i needed full party i think
2/18 00:10:24.598  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: and it instantly was throwing me off >->
2/18 00:10:29.848  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Just imagine how much less of an issue it would be, if all those of Teldrassil were still here. He has the vision to see it come to pass!"
2/18 00:10:32.597  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: oooo
2/18 00:10:49.872  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Silence, worm!
2/18 00:10:54.054  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: okay GOod luck to you
2/18 00:10:55.626  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: It's Time.
2/18 00:10:57.491  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Aye
2/18 00:11:01.591  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So what is he up to then?
2/18 00:11:02.783  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: The real reason why we came here
2/18 00:11:06.998  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn kicks the highborne again. 
2/18 00:11:08.721  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: And who is he?
2/18 00:11:27.792  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Sabo would had thrown me into that Maw looking hole if he was here
2/18 00:11:28.030  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: give us your energie, LFG chat
2/18 00:11:39.731  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *When he speaks about Teldrassil, Tessaemay snaps and throws him an arcane lightning. If not stopped... she may send -another-. She clearly looks quite unstable, right now.*
2/18 00:11:42.217  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: oh
2/18 00:11:45.337  Arandell-ArgentDawn gestures at the highborne.
2/18 00:11:46.848  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: You're such a DansGame sometimes
2/18 00:12:08.344  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: WAIT FGOR ME
2/18 00:12:10.532  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal isn't fast enough to catch the first lightning, but she catches Tessa's hand and forcefully stops her from sending another. "Not yet."*
2/18 00:12:20.120  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Winterflower grunts and spits out some blood: "No, I won;t jepordize his work any more!"
2/18 00:12:45.975  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: He says 'his work' with reverence, almost as though talking about Elune in a sermon.
2/18 00:12:59.331  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: im too scared to loot
2/18 00:13:02.405  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: mount doko
2/18 00:13:03.004  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: u can go first
2/18 00:13:09.264  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She shakes heavily but doesn't try to break free from Thalyndrae's grap, avoiding the elf another lightning.*
2/18 00:13:23.356  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: LET'S
2/18 00:13:32.541  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2/18 00:13:40.494  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *Winderflowers sentence is shorted out by crackling lightning. He arcs his back in pain and slumps back down. Consciousness leaves him.*
2/18 00:13:49.168  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I just got 3 items, what a shitty loot
2/18 00:13:59.203  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn 's angry expression gains features of disgust as she looks towards the highborne and hears his reverence for whomever he was referring to.
2/18 00:14:19.058  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: my inventory full and I can't even mount here to sell them
2/18 00:14:21.258  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: feelsbad
2/18 00:14:36.589  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn pokes the unconscious body with her stave, huffing.
2/18 00:14:40.339  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, suppose that is that for the questions for now.
2/18 00:14:51.230  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: We'll question him at a later date, then.
2/18 00:14:59.049  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: well
2/18 00:15:12.903  Nitzuss kneels down.
2/18 00:15:16.096  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn:  igot some lil shit
2/18 00:15:18.556  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn mutters sarcastically. "Good job..." seeing that her kicks could have any part in it, she shoots a short glance towards Tessa.
2/18 00:15:23.746  To Elmandir-ArgentDawn: I may have said soon, but it seems I lied
2/18 00:15:25.158  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: can u trade him too ?
2/18 00:15:30.482  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: no...
2/18 00:15:36.137  To Elmandir-ArgentDawn: The last bit took a lot longer than expected
2/18 00:15:36.455  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: guess all mine
2/18 00:15:36.455  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm. We can get some more out of it. So what happened to you? What was this one doing?
2/18 00:15:39.612  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: can I throw him in to the maelstrom

2/18 00:15:59.258  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: We were sent back to the past, before Teldrassil burned.
2/18 00:16:04.142  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks like she could snaps again -very easily-. Instable shaking running throught her whole body and her eyes glowing from a frightened and angered light.
2/18 00:16:07.581  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn goes to pat him down one last time, then she reaches into her backpack and secures the wrists of Winterflower with rope.
2/18 00:16:11.743  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: pre mop anduin was a freak of nature
2/18 00:16:13.215  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: prob a frenchy look he has a baquet in his bagpack
2/18 00:16:19.645  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: lmao
2/18 00:16:25.115  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Or rather...
2/18 00:16:35.129  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let us go find the elder and then can explain.
2/18 00:16:39.153  Lyndraé nods at Arandell.

2/18 00:16:55.758  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: he is flexing dem muscles for real for the dragon girls
2/18 00:17:08.801  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: all my homies hate thrall
2/18 00:17:09.092  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Last thing you find is a small rod, red in colour with silver markings.
2/18 00:17:22.282  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn calls for Starchaser and looks towards Nitzuss. "Sister. Help me tie this filth up and pack him on Starchaser's back."
2/18 00:17:33.716  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: DansGame
2/18 00:17:34.645  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: green jesus

2/18 00:18:33.626  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: "too much haft"
2/18 00:18:39.337  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn 's hands find their way into the pockets as she pulls out a small red rod with silver markings. She holds it up briefly before her eyes, beforing looking around at the gathered,*"What's this?"*
2/18 00:18:40.150  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: 'swords are sooo alliance'
2/18 00:18:41.160  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There are still the remnants of the spellwork, and a building. You could choose to explore those later, in downtime and clean up the remnants.
2/18 00:18:41.502  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: hi Buzzer
2/18 00:18:50.752  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Atleast Thrall doesnt need a redemption Arc

2/18 00:19:27.599  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: DansGame
2/18 00:19:34.291  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: unironically was in a goldshire server with someone who used to post that filth
2/18 00:19:36.007  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (*eyes the clock* Definetly downtime thing.)
2/18 00:19:50.971  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: do you need to watch the mandolorian to watch the boba fett one
2/18 00:19:56.553  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "In general I will be looking to run an event from 20:00 until around 22:30"
2/18 00:19:59.739  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: i need something new to watch while i eat dinner
2/18 00:20:00.274  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn holds the rod out towards Thalyndrae and Tessaemay, offering it. "He had this on him."
2/18 00:20:08.376  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (and hide that photobombing druid)
2/18 00:20:11.761  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I tried! I failed
2/18 00:20:13.667  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: First time i came to Goldshire as a female hunter, someone whispered me (this was back in 2015)
2/18 00:20:21.711  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: and he asked if he could draw me character for erotica on his website
2/18 00:20:24.429  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn tries to take the big weight that is Tessa and move her to Nitzuss so she can take the rod.
2/18 00:20:27.922  Irrissia-ArgentDawn is unlikely capable to take anyrthing right now, due to her hands being held by Thalyndrae.
2/18 00:20:31.817  You lie down.
2/18 00:20:39.086  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (almost. Just the tail... Ah There.)
2/18 00:20:39.334  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: The big weight ? She is like 50kg xD
2/18 00:20:53.946  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: ...she is 50?
2/18 00:21:02.168  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Toilet Taratino time
2/18 00:21:16.378  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yes ? She is super light.
2/18 00:21:20.429  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: i added someone from goldshire on bnet cos they seemed cool, then they kept asking what i was doing, i look where they are on bnet and they're following me levelling my alt :(
2/18 00:21:26.484  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: ...that's malnourished
2/18 00:21:31.305  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ... Maybe ?
2/18 00:21:33.556  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Was it Keil?
2/18 00:21:38.530  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: 215cm @ 50kg isn't that like borerline dead?

2/18 00:21:45.831  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: for 215 she should have like 100
2/18 00:21:54.688  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Just the bones there.
2/18 00:22:01.148  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: not out loud
2/18 00:22:05.165  [4. LookingForGroup] Yorakhunt-ArgentDawn: lmao

2/18 00:22:13.321  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Let me check my char sheet, 2.
2/18 00:22:15.336  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: but i got that booba character with the honka donks yknow
2/18 00:22:19.143  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: attracts the creeps
2/18 00:22:39.209  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: That took only slightly longer than I expected. I hope you all enjoyed and had fun:-)
2/18 00:22:53.338  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn holds it out for a moment more, allowing inspection, before tucking it into her backpack.
2/18 00:23:01.687  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal inspects the rod she is given.*
2/18 00:23:13.887  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (that came out very sexual)
2/18 00:23:22.845  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (I swear she's not doing onlyfans)
2/18 00:23:28.540  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn (xD)
2/18 00:23:32.106  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: 75* my bad. Was confusing with my blood elf.
2/18 00:23:35.156  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: There is the tiniest of enchantment on it. It has a particular tune to it, but nothing  more.
2/18 00:23:42.710  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn ties the man up and tries to place him on Starchaser's back. Depending on his size and weight, she would either succeed or fail.
2/18 00:24:12.750  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Nothing seemingly of importance, but keep it on you, for now.
2/18 00:24:22.452  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Alyssrea succeeds, he is lanky and not all that heavy for a Kaldorei.
2/18 00:24:23.502  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Thanks a alot for hosting Arlien :) It was cool!
2/18 00:24:41.165  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (Yes, thank you for DMing once again!)
2/18 00:24:45.972  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (It was super nice. Got my hyped even MORE.)
2/18 00:24:56.957  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: Thanks for hosting! Hopefully there will be more to come :)
2/18 00:25:10.559  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (You know. Beside the fact that Tessa is not functionning anymore again xD But I personally had fun !)
2/18 00:25:10.964  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Thank you for hosting it, sorry for my dumb brain sometimes :<
2/18 00:25:22.403  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (And more of our reputation with less than lethal stuff is still intact. We still kill people regardless.)
2/18 00:25:41.450  [9. Community:159037872:1] Tharandrél-ArgentDawn: Nighty night.
2/18 00:25:46.495  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: gnight!
2/18 00:25:50.081  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (At least not kaldorei civilians this time... :S)
2/18 00:25:50.081  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn turns towards the others. "Could you see him and my saber back to Astranaar? I have one more thing to finish here." her black eyes flare up, it wasn't too hard to guess what she was planning.
2/18 00:25:50.991  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: G'night o/
2/18 00:26:18.071  [9. Community:159037872:1] Makhalann-ArgentDawn: nn o/
2/18 00:27:07.921  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do not destroy anything useful. We should still investigate the area afterwards.
2/18 00:27:16.843  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn looks at Alyssrea and nods once, "I'll take
2/18 00:27:29.140  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Thank you for being here :-) Hope you enjoyed the little gimick.
2/18 00:27:30.780  Tharandrél has gone offline.
2/18 00:27:31.171  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn looks at Alyssrea and nods once, "I'll take them."
2/18 00:27:35.650  Elrinde has gone offline.
2/18 00:27:43.079  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: :D
2/18 00:28:14.206  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn bows her head towards Nitzuss and grins, then glancing towards Arandell briefly. "I don't intend to linger on the site, don't worry."
2/18 00:28:18.758  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (I was about to ask when did you kill kaldorei civilians.)
2/18 00:28:22.899  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (But then, I remembered.)
2/18 00:28:24.298  Alyssrea's Starchaser is dismissed.
2/18 00:28:32.126  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I'll return later to clean up all the traces of temporal magic, as well.
2/18 00:28:32.713  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Fair enough. Good hunting, sister.
2/18 00:28:56.616  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (brb 2 mins follow on tessa)
2/18 00:29:05.895  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goddess watch over you, sister. Walk in shadows.
2/18 00:29:23.163  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn runs off without further words, seeking to track the goblins which ran off earlier. If she would find them, the forest's wrath with precision and accuracy of Alyssrea's arrows would find their backs and heads.
2/18 00:29:54.510  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Shall we move to the camp and someone can tell us what exactly happened then?
2/18 00:30:11.168  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly.
2/18 00:30:19.694  Nitzuss nods at Arandell.
2/18 00:30:45.652  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn grabs the reins of Starchaser carefully and leads the large cat onwards.
2/18 00:30:56.469  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Darn it, we were so professional about keeping all expect one alive and now they are all dead in the end anyways. :D
2/18 00:30:57.181  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: You find them, 2 Goblins, 1 Human dragging one unconcious Dwarf allong.
2/18 00:31:00.310  Irrissia-ArgentDawn walks slowly after Arandell.
2/18 00:31:22.800  You receive loot: Cracked Helmet

2/18 00:31:32.918  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Well, don't take a zealot then ;p)
2/18 00:31:45.768  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Honestly it is likely better that way.
2/18 00:32:08.218  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: Do you kill the lot of them, only the Human has a weapon on him.
2/18 00:32:16.796  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Indeed, the mistake will be corrected.
2/18 00:32:24.101  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yup.
2/18 00:33:14.659  Arandell-ArgentDawn bows his head at Arlien.
2/18 00:33:14.924  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: G-Gloinx ?
2/18 00:33:27.677  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune.
2/18 00:33:29.802  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: He's dead, son.
2/18 00:33:37.087  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Alyssrea would bring a swift end to the goblins but spares the human and the dwarf. Although she had low opinion on all, her racism towards the goblins was most superb. She would warn the human to drag his dwarven companion far from Kalimdor, for the »
2/18 00:33:37.087  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: » next time she would deliver Goddess's judgement
2/18 00:33:42.014  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Everyone alive and... mostly well.
2/18 00:33:46.605  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Arlièn.
2/18 00:33:49.572  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances at Tessa briefly.
2/18 00:33:57.308  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn approaches, securing Starchaser at the edge of the camp.
2/18 00:33:59.919  Irrissia-ArgentDawn used the walk to calm down, a tiny little bit, and looks less about to throw lightning at someone, and more like she is in dire need to sit down and cry.
2/18 00:34:01.552  Nitzuss bows before you.
2/18 00:34:05.577  Arlièn-ArgentDawn glances over the gathered, looking for injuries or scratches. When she spots none she bows her head.
2/18 00:34:32.420  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I need a bingo for Tessa
2/18 00:34:54.800  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Too young. You must be at least 750 years to enter.
2/18 00:35:19.269  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: drama in trade chat and I check what guild they from
2/18 00:35:19.743  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: We'll see about that...
2/18 00:35:24.496  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: and its Welcome
2/18 00:35:24.723  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is good to hear. I take it the others went on ahead right away?
2/18 00:35:28.846  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: Only the goblins could be found dead
2/18 00:35:30.515  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Dont lie to me
2/18 00:35:37.337  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Bills from Welcome!
2/18 00:35:42.309  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn unstraps and lifts Winterflower from the back of the saber, dragging him inside and before the Elder but slightly to the side, leaving him on a bedroll.
2/18 00:35:48.717  [4. LookingForGroup] Yorakhunt-ArgentDawn: oh shit drama?
2/18 00:35:58.414  [4. LookingForGroup] Yorakhunt-ArgentDawn: hit me up fam, whats happening
2/18 00:36:01.998  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Who is that?
2/18 00:36:13.841  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: whats the tea
2/18 00:36:21.184  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian]  Well, the ruins are empty. Still some looking around to be done. And explanation to whatever happened to half of us.
2/18 00:36:22.794  Arlièn-ArgentDawn looks with concern to their injured brother.
2/18 00:36:50.993  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: someone trying to sell a Swift Lovebird and they're undercutting eachother so one guy started calling the other a pedo
2/18 00:36:58.103  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: called him Prince Andrew!

2/18 00:37:14.006  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks to Arandell with  a raised eyebrow.
2/18 00:37:18.601  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: the Bill guy yeah

2/18 00:37:53.264  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: i saw someone in trade ask if they can report undercutters lmao
2/18 00:38:26.317  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Flash of light and Nitzuss, Thalyndrae and Alyssrea dissappeared and then arrived back with some help from Tessa through a portal of sort with this prisoner.
2/18 00:38:37.272  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: They would have  been headed east, towards the mountains with Felwood. But after your visit, they quickly turn about and head to Auberdine.
2/18 00:39:00.431  [9. Community:159037872:1] Makhalann-ArgentDawn: going to bed too , nn
2/18 00:39:05.224  Thyreena has gone offline.
2/18 00:39:10.397  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: G'night o/
2/18 00:39:13.949  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Quite curious to hear what happened between those two events.
2/18 00:39:17.016  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Gnight Mak!
2/18 00:39:22.592  Makhalann has gone offline.
2/18 00:39:23.000  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: G'night!
2/18 00:39:23.981  Nirandae has come online.
2/18 00:39:48.309  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods, she looks between the others.
2/18 00:39:51.978  [4. LookingForGroup] Yorakhunt-ArgentDawn: im guessing blizz didnt add that when they banned boosting communities
2/18 00:39:54.369  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: This is Winterflower, presumably. We found him in the ruins.. of years ago. He was tampering with temporal magics in an effort to supress what happened to Teldrassil and our people, it seems.
2/18 00:39:58.494  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Ops
2/18 00:40:02.495  [4. LookingForGroup] Yorakhunt-ArgentDawn: also "the girl" isnt coming

2/18 00:40:33.518  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] This is Winterflower, presumably. We found him in the ruins.. of years ago. He was tampering with temportal magics in an effort to supress what happened to Teldrassil and our people, it seems.
2/18 00:40:35.045  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i was just making sure 
2/18 00:40:42.072  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Idk Yorak has like 2 hour delay DansGame
2/18 00:40:49.599  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn glances at Thalyndrae as if searching for approval.
2/18 00:40:53.448  [4. LookingForGroup] Yorakhunt-ArgentDawn: i do dungeons dude
2/18 00:41:01.350  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: yorak a gamer

2/18 00:41:10.816  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: my man
2/18 00:41:11.322  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sounds like a branch from the Winterflow's.
2/18 00:41:34.480  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums.
2/18 00:41:37.021  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea follows the human, dragging the dwarf back towards Auberdine from distance. She would miss the debriefing while on it* ((going to head to sleep soon so I'm just listening OOCly))
2/18 00:42:14.931  Nirandae has gone offline.
2/18 00:42:31.958  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes suddenly at the mention of Teldrassil. But as there is no one to toast, no lightning follows.
2/18 00:42:32.277  Thyreena has come online.
2/18 00:43:10.497  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: So we just talk about Teldrassil when we need Tessa to kill people.
2/18 00:43:37.070  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Sounds reasonable to me.
2/18 00:43:49.832  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Well.
2/18 00:43:51.404  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: No ?
2/18 00:43:54.830  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: What about that ?
2/18 00:43:57.274  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You know of them?
2/18 00:44:51.809  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: returns
2/18 00:45:11.300  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No,  just an assumption on family names. It is likely nothing
2/18 00:45:15.617  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods.
2/18 00:45:43.854  Arandell-ArgentDawn gives Arlien a bit of a look.
2/18 00:45:51.687  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He tripped and fell before we could properly interrogate him, but from what I could gather he serves at someone else's command.
2/18 00:46:22.137  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: 'He tripped' burnmarks and bruises all over.
2/18 00:46:26.665  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: :P
2/18 00:46:32.561  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would not hurt to ask...
2/18 00:46:33.291  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: you bastard
2/18 00:46:50.558  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and frowns: "So this problem has not been resolved yet then."
2/18 00:46:53.266  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: And randomly hit by lightning from blue... dark sky?
2/18 00:47:05.034  |Kq18|k whispers: Ngl, first time I read winterflower, I was about to say "Acrona ?" xD
2/18 00:47:08.771  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: where my 9.2 cinematic at
2/18 00:47:09.703  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: DansGame
2/18 00:47:21.166  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: soon TM
2/18 00:47:40.049  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: XD Why lying on that, tho ? Just say Tessa looses her shit and throw a lightning.
2/18 00:47:42.132  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: awh you can pet these cats
2/18 00:47:43.406  To |Kq18|k: I used a namegenerator. I thought about it for a moment, but kinda liked it
2/18 00:48:02.040  |Kq18|k whispers: Made me laught xD But like. I figured it was just a fun fact
2/18 00:48:02.040  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Technically he did fall over just then
2/18 00:48:08.583  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Truuue
2/18 00:48:17.134  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: also the RP here is intense
2/18 00:48:37.860  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: they'll report yo
2/18 00:48:42.371  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: for anti semitism
2/18 00:48:44.817  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There were crates marked with the name 'Snowplow Cartel', likely those goblins.
2/18 00:49:11.450  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Temporal magic to supress what happened to Teldrassil, to undo what took place. That is a giant endeavour.
2/18 00:49:14.466  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I gladly take it
2/18 00:49:17.378  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: If that means i can be with her
2/18 00:49:30.290  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The name brings to mind Winterspring and Everlook. These goblins are getting more brazen by the day involving themselves in our lands and affairs.
2/18 00:49:31.026  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Guild: I Never Had A Korean GF It's Time
2/18 00:49:32.881  [4. LookingForGroup] Philmikehunt-ArgentDawn: is this a new girl?
2/18 00:49:50.596  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You think they were here on their own accord?
2/18 00:49:59.069  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: i totally had score
2/18 00:50:59.145  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] At least the people assisting seemed to know very little. Likely just hired mercenaries.
2/18 00:51:48.940  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It sounds more likely. What were they hired for?
2/18 00:52:02.166  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: okay back
2/18 00:52:05.499  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: longer than expected
2/18 00:52:29.000  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He mentioned an unknown party that was 'working' with a vision. Referring simply to the party as "He".
2/18 00:52:38.031  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Phil
2/18 00:52:42.132  [4. LookingForGroup] Philmikehunt-ArgentDawn: suh
2/18 00:52:48.133  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: He also mentioned several other people working towards the same goal as him./
2/18 00:52:52.532  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: he after draenei male
2/18 00:52:58.251  Nitzuss nods at Lyndraé.
2/18 00:53:04.013  [4. LookingForGroup] Philmikehunt-ArgentDawn: who? gim?
2/18 00:53:08.363  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: ya
2/18 00:53:25.139  [4. LookingForGroup] Philmikehunt-ArgentDawn: man just wants some goat dong
2/18 00:53:26.872  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It doesn't sound like something that can be done by one person alone.
2/18 00:53:38.159  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: thats why he want That Girl?
2/18 00:54:01.528  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn swings her backpack around and lets it slip of her shoulder, reaching into it. A moment later she produces a rod and offers it up for inspection or taking. "He had this on him."
2/18 00:54:04.013  [4. LookingForGroup] Philmikehunt-ArgentDawn: idk man, do draenei males or females have larger dongs?
2/18 00:54:05.106  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As for the mercenaries. To keep people out. Dig holes for... droppoints for something to be brought. eh, back? By this prisoner.
2/18 00:54:17.140  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: that's a good question tbh
2/18 00:54:18.571  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How did they plan to accomplish this?
2/18 00:54:28.158  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There was some books they were transporting... Tessa has them.
2/18 00:54:38.439  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and looks between Arandell and Thalyndrae.
2/18 00:54:38.439  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: He mentioned calculations and alignments... My hypothesis is that they planned to change things just enough that Teldrassil would be avoided.
2/18 00:54:50.138  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: i be having such a good time, then my spotify starts playing pitbull :(
2/18 00:54:50.373  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: One small change can have a grand effect in the end.
2/18 00:54:51.740  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: as an ex-draenei I think maybe female draenei more stacked
2/18 00:55:03.193  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: block him!
2/18 00:55:15.885  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn holds it out.
2/18 00:55:16.331  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: One urn here, one lamp there... The calculations are presumably in his notes and those books.
2/18 00:55:35.160  Arlièn-ArgentDawn takes a closer look at the rod, examening it quickly.
2/18 00:55:53.982  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: GIMLIX WHJATS GOING ON
2/18 00:56:08.582  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Curious little bauble.
2/18 00:56:44.443  Arandell-ArgentDawn huffs slightly. "One must admit... tempting idea."
2/18 00:56:55.825  Annaeya has gone offline.
2/18 00:57:05.966  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: we're safe keil
2/18 00:57:08.869  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks towards Teldrassil, or what remains of it, for a moment.
2/18 00:57:17.237  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: ow damn that small one over there looks yummy
2/18 00:57:19.766  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: You know those clowns?
2/18 00:57:28.538  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Never seen them in my life but somehow they knew me...
2/18 00:57:30.307  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Thalyndrae, offering the rod back to Nitzuss: That would make sense."
2/18 00:57:43.705  Thyreena has gone offline.
2/18 00:57:46.400  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Okay i see something much better
2/18 00:57:46.400  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Maybe they knew your father... the King
2/18 00:57:50.576  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: G-Gloinx
2/18 00:57:56.654  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn takes it and looks to Thalyndrae, "Did you wish to examine this, sister?"
2/18 00:57:58.448  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I can feel its pull as well.
2/18 00:58:10.693  Káthene has gone offline.
2/18 00:58:14.817  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: At one point.
2/18 00:58:34.140  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes again at the mention of Teldrassil, needing to sit. She moves away, near the tent.
2/18 00:59:06.283  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn offers the rod to Thalyndrae.
2/18 00:59:08.275  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: I can see this campaign will be fun for Tessa. Everyone talking about Teldrassil. :P
2/18 00:59:08.961  Arlièn-ArgentDawn looks to Teldrassil, lowering her  ears for a moment.
2/18 00:59:15.123  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: YEAAAAH
2/18 00:59:22.855  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I'm making that bingo while she is processing
2/18 00:59:32.235  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn accepts the rod, putting it away for now though.
2/18 00:59:32.584  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Whole-Body Shrinka'
2/18 01:00:13.921  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, few things still remain to be done. Securing the prisoner for further questions. We need some arcane way of restraining him?
2/18 01:00:41.602  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Some way to stop his magic, yes. Warden bindings could also work.
2/18 01:00:51.575  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Ah, one more thing: Unless stated specifically that you are holding on to a certain item, items will be available for next events even if you are not there.
2/18 01:01:21.302  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And a location for it.
2/18 01:01:34.729  Lyndraé nods at Arandell.
2/18 01:01:39.977  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Any ideas for that?
2/18 01:01:43.556  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I reckon we can see that done back in Ashenvale.
2/18 01:01:47.733  Lyndraé nods at you.
2/18 01:02:03.890  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: nelfery spanwed front me
2/18 01:02:23.233  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And more careful inspection around the ruins for something we might have missed.
2/18 01:02:37.855  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods at Arandell.
2/18 01:02:50.420  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Whom of you will return there?
2/18 01:02:55.011  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: After such inspection, I greatly advise removing any trace this spellwork ever happened.
2/18 01:03:03.842  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Agreed.
2/18 01:03:11.717  Arlièn-ArgentDawn nods to Thalyndrae.
2/18 01:03:23.260  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nervously plays with the edge of her tabard.
2/18 01:03:26.889  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm. I will head back there, but can not do anything about spells.
2/18 01:03:31.257  Lyndraé nods at Arandell.
2/18 01:03:39.494  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I'll do the spellwork after your inspection.
2/18 01:03:43.811  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn lifts her hand, "I'll go."
2/18 01:03:45.767  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Also, seems that they played nice together
2/18 01:03:51.500  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods at Thalyndrae.
2/18 01:03:57.580  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: I didn't tell Thal it was Cad.
2/18 01:04:03.491  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Might as well join me then... but if something explodes.
2/18 01:04:07.226  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: He wouldn't have joined, if I knew.
2/18 01:04:11.117  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: he*
2/18 01:04:18.714  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: ...I'm still sorry for that.
2/18 01:04:32.399  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] (nvm I'll stay here, read it wrong)
2/18 01:04:36.006  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm... at least you are not the one trying to kill us twice in a row... so far.
2/18 01:04:56.937  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I was like and you three!...oh...fuck...well I said it now
2/18 01:05:16.648  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Mh..
2/18 01:05:24.619  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well, you can join us Nitzuss on the downtime. I assume it is just discord post for the rest of the nights activity again.
2/18 01:05:29.778  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (I have a list of items Tessa took.)
2/18 01:05:34.489  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Arlien please don't make it blow up
2/18 01:05:34.857  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: yush
2/18 01:05:38.872  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Arandell will actually kill me
2/18 01:05:45.274  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There is a box
2/18 01:05:47.194  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (Same for Thal)
2/18 01:05:48.490  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It ticks
2/18 01:05:48.772  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: What ?
2/18 01:06:00.418  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: oh, makes sense :P
2/18 01:06:14.432  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: i gotta run any minute
2/18 01:06:21.272  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (Aly didn't take anything, Mort still has the scroll from Felwood event though. But Aly can fetch that for later use if needed since Mort is elsewhere)
2/18 01:06:23.859  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: .... WEll, it doesn't count if Aran just opens a trapped box again. At least as long as Thaly did not touch it first. He is not that irrational.
2/18 01:06:32.382  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (And the slime sample >_>)
2/18 01:06:32.892  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: xD
2/18 01:06:44.819  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Those are not related to this event
2/18 01:06:59.692  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (I thought you meant for the chain of events generally)
2/18 01:07:17.066  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Tessa got : The books, the sheets of papers, and the speech gem.)
2/18 01:07:17.747  Alyssrea creates: Phial of Serenity.
2/18 01:07:17.888  Alyssrea creates: Phial of Serenity.
2/18 01:07:18.061  Alyssrea creates: Phial of Serenity.
2/18 01:07:26.154  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: When I lopped the three of them together in for the time shift
2/18 01:07:40.631  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: (Ok guys, I gotta bail :) Thanks for DMing Arlien and thanks for the RP rest of you!)
2/18 01:07:48.730  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: (Cya next time!)
2/18 01:07:49.316  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: G'night o/
2/18 01:07:49.718  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (Thal got the rod, the two orbs, the other half of the speech gem, the urn and the shards)
2/18 01:07:50.093  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (And technically, a mental map of what the spell work looks like, and she will likely draw it on paper later.)
2/18 01:07:53.991  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Nn Not !)
2/18 01:07:53.991  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (For once Aran did not hoard a single piece of information. So far at least.)
2/18 01:07:55.423  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: gnight :)
2/18 01:08:01.679  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Night!
2/18 01:08:08.986  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Oh that. Tbf, they were already in the same event so eh. Whatever
2/18 01:08:09.245  Nitzuss has gone offline.
2/18 01:08:18.655  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (I'll do the same. Thanks for DMing Arlien and thank you all for the RP!)
2/18 01:08:24.879  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: :-)
2/18 01:08:28.013  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: G'night!
2/18 01:08:36.092  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Ninight too !)
2/18 01:08:39.707  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (G'night!)
2/18 01:08:43.957  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: G'night :-)
2/18 01:08:59.347  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (And I will downtime stuff about books and papers, maybe not tonight as Tessa is a bit broken atm. But before the next event sure.)
2/18 01:08:59.347  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Anything else? Aside Tessa needing an escort back.
2/18 01:09:19.011  |Kq18|k whispers: (AND. I will try to be sure to NOT take any big clue before getting timelost.)
2/18 01:09:49.663  |Kq18|k whispers: (Because with the common trope to give Tessa all the books and notes, they are going to have trouble. So either I leave her bag behind or something... But the clues STAY in the present xD)
2/18 01:09:51.177  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Where do we keep Winterflower. We can't keep him at the Hermitage.
2/18 01:09:58.577  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (I assume we are using the RP corner IC-channel again for downtime stuff relating to the campaign?)
2/18 01:10:15.212  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There should be a channel for it
2/18 01:10:20.018  |Kq18|k whispers: (And, btw : Planning :D)
2/18 01:10:33.318  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yep yep, just put stuff in IC channel
2/18 01:10:40.118  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: It basically only serves for campaigns.
2/18 01:11:20.445  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well, there is the glimmer one but last time we did not use it for the ICposts when Tessa had the campaing running. IT was mostly signups and general info, no?
2/18 01:11:33.063  To |Kq18|k: Tessa disapears! She leaves all her belongings behind. Arives butt naked terminator style in the past
2/18 01:11:45.887  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yes, it's normally how it goes, unless you really want it to work differently ?
2/18 01:11:56.128  |Kq18|k whispers: xD
2/18 01:11:56.128  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Ah derp, I am just getting tired
2/18 01:12:17.521  No player named 'Nitzuss' is currently playing.
2/18 01:12:28.301  |Kq18|k whispers: Well. I would rather her to keep her back, only because she can bring back stuffs from her time in the past and NOT being weaponless neither :p
2/18 01:12:33.316  |Kq18|k whispers: *bag
2/18 01:12:38.165  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *patpat*
2/18 01:12:39.892  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Think the Spire has some holding cells?
2/18 01:12:50.297  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Not that it matters wich one so much, just as long as we keep it in one place. So... IC-channel it is?
2/18 01:12:52.370  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: So, yes => IC chanel = downtime / GP chanel => Infos and stuffs
2/18 01:13:05.276  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Oki
2/18 01:14:05.160  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Suppose so, if that is allowed. Much better than hermitage or the town at the very least.
2/18 01:14:25.456  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "A regular man we can hold. A mage we cannot."
2/18 01:15:02.840  Irrissia-ArgentDawn switched her position to hold her knees, slightly rocking on herself.
2/18 01:15:05.214  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not without aid. And frankly one highborne is enough there.
2/18 01:15:49.834  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I did learn something here: Delnara Greensnow is a council member. She has been spending a lot of gold on rebuilding and tending to the refugees in Stormwind.
2/18 01:16:32.071  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She is to return come night, if the weather agrees.
2/18 01:17:22.144  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, suppose someone better greet her with some questions too then.
2/18 01:17:59.815  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/18 01:19:12.947  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So, there is a mysterious man trying to tamper with time and see Teldrassil restored. He is conducting experiments here on Auberdine, by his servant Winterflower.
2/18 01:20:04.789  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And Greensow... provides funds for mercenaries?
2/18 01:20:14.192  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Saprinha-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/18 01:20:21.067  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes a little.
2/18 01:20:22.519  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: *snow
2/18 01:20:24.777  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They have protection in the form of mercenaries from the Snowplow Cartel, and council member Greensnow is at their side.
2/18 01:20:58.565  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Arandell: "Could be."
2/18 01:21:11.759  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn moves next to Tessa to soothe her, wrapping an arm around her.
2/18 01:21:17.665  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Lovely, concidering we ruined things here and can be identified as ones responsible.
2/18 01:22:15.678  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Unless our sister killed everyone.
2/18 01:22:22.691  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Arandell.
2/18 01:23:04.163  Irrissia-ArgentDawn rests her head on Thalyndrae, drained. As she feels the presence of the highborne, her nerves break down -or she just allow them to do so- and she cries silently.
2/18 01:23:15.852  To |Kq18|k: I can just imagine Tessa walking up to a highborne: "I need your sandals, your clothes and your magic carpet."
2/18 01:23:18.154  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn caresses Tessa's head gently.
2/18 01:23:34.686  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (I think I'll be going to sleep now)
2/18 01:23:49.203  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (I'll drop something in downtime and RP tomorrow)
2/18 01:23:54.448  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (Thanks for the event again and good night!)
2/18 01:24:07.381  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Thank you, g'night o/ :-)
2/18 01:24:11.332  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Sure sure. Just a question. Does Thaly come back with Tessa or join her later ? -Or leaves her alone MONSTER-)
2/18 01:24:12.331  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (G'night!)
2/18 01:24:41.797  |Kq18|k whispers: xD Because she is in the past with nothing ?
2/18 01:25:01.973  |Kq18|k whispers: More like Thaly style. Tessa would be panicking under a table, john connor style.
2/18 01:25:17.157  Lyndraé has gone offline.
2/18 01:25:56.800  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Daltharia, can you see to Winterflower's being held at Stardust Spire?
2/18 01:26:10.489  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A few of the local sentinels can accompany you.
2/18 01:26:17.141  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: This can be done OC, if you like.
2/18 01:26:26.947  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Unless I'm needed here I suppose I can do that.
2/18 01:26:40.038  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I am also at risk of falling over. I make things to complicated, to the players and myself.
2/18 01:27:01.742  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I'm really, really, concerned for the futur event xD
2/18 01:27:03.240  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think between Thalyndrae, Arandell and Nitzuss, they have that covered.
2/18 01:27:14.462  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Well I've already fallen asleep twise so...
2/18 01:27:25.902  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Arlièn can walk Tessaemay home
2/18 01:27:28.528  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And in case Raven wishes to join as well.
2/18 01:27:38.930  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: If you want
2/18 01:28:28.622  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/18 01:29:12.803  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So, we need to get some answers from Winterflower.  See who this person is he serves.
2/18 01:30:00.747  To |Kq18|k: I had to laugh a couple of times already over what took place. The hints
2/18 01:30:16.904  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm. You will try pleasantly before letting me and Raven come up with otherways?
2/18 01:31:12.107  |Kq18|k whispers: Ngl, I think Tessa did pretty well, all things considered xD
2/18 01:31:27.732  |Kq18|k whispers: And our group managed to get around quite well, we just took our time.
2/18 01:31:28.813  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] See if my way is more convincing, hmm?
2/18 01:32:13.451  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm. Better start with asking nicely at least.
2/18 01:32:13.797  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I love how everyone forgot that Tessa actually got every answer from Kelthulus last time, because she is so broken she can barely looks like a fitting choice to help xD
2/18 01:32:33.387  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Christ this char need some therapy.
2/18 01:32:38.643  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes. Tonight Tessa is useless weight.
2/18 01:32:53.984  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I swear, I did my best to wait until the very end for her to snap.
2/18 01:33:08.765  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: But we weren't starting well, she was already doing pretty bad before the event started xD
2/18 01:33:18.824  To |Kq18|k: They did. I was dropping a lot of hints and making it easier though beacsue of the running around
2/18 01:33:30.508  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes, but the reasoning for not suggesting Tessa to do anything. When she gathers some pieces of herself again then another thing. :)
2/18 01:33:39.742  |Kq18|k whispers: And I'm thanking my guts feeling I took Tessa away of that tent.
2/18 01:33:57.359  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Which will happen, I hope.
2/18 01:34:11.310  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: But like. Teldrassil and the Void are two big NONO.
2/18 01:34:23.371  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes, for the first 5 minutes at the inn before we start talking about Teldrassil tomorrow. :P
2/18 01:34:24.393  To |Kq18|k: The building, hmm? WIth the hint:  "Shit is happening in the centre?"
2/18 01:35:02.937  |Kq18|k whispers: yeah, that and I wasn't sure it was a good idea to split her from the main group but hell. If she went trapped with those in the past...
2/18 01:35:20.560  |Kq18|k whispers: Well. I could have signed out of all the futur event. She would have been broken for weeks.
2/18 01:35:29.483  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: >.> Oh my gosh.
2/18 01:35:30.588  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Eitherway, I will see who heads back. We will return by noon. If not... we might have... whatever happend to the others.
2/18 01:36:04.096  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] With Thalyndrae there, I trust you will not run into to much trouble.
2/18 01:36:25.685  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: It's either Lightning or Meltdown, with Teldrassil. No inbetween. I'm sure none of you noticed she NEVER speaks of Teldrassil. And when people do, she leaves super quietly to NOT be asked about.
2/18 01:36:35.618  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Trust is not a word I would use when it comes to her.
2/18 01:37:51.277  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Maybe. But there is yourself as well. And she is skilled in this area of expertise.
2/18 01:38:00.582  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: It comes up rarely directly since everyone just refers to the war most of the time avoiding mentioning a lot about the tree itself it seems.
2/18 01:38:03.215  Arlièn-ArgentDawn looks to Tessaemay and gives her a smile.
2/18 01:38:16.407  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I know. Skill we need.
2/18 01:38:49.777  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I at least do that on purpose, think most do.
2/18 01:38:56.979  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stares at the ground as she did for the last hour. Even with Thalyndrae's presence, she didn't open her mouth, or speaks, or did anything else than breath and cries.
2/18 01:38:59.979  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Same.
2/18 01:39:50.112  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I know, but that's a big deal for Tessa, tbf. So... The few time it happened, she dodged. x) I -wasn't- expecting to run throught it as straightly in a campaiiiign.
2/18 01:39:51.013  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at Tessa and sighs quietly, followed by brief sad smile.
2/18 01:40:47.734  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Come Tessaemay, we should be heading back.

2/19 23:12:11.689  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You already asked her ?
2/19 23:12:13.955  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears.
2/19 23:12:48.422  Raeneya-ArgentDawn chuckles softly and waves a dismissive hand. "It is quite alright. I don't mind repeating myself."
2/19 23:12:53.222  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm. But oh do not look like that. Rather natural question to ask.
2/19 23:13:02.922  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed.
2/19 23:13:48.878  You are no longer Away.
2/19 23:16:06.727  Arandell-ArgentDawn bows his head towards Arlien.
2/19 23:16:11.308  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, elder.
2/19 23:16:23.438  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Sounds very gr-...
2/19 23:16:27.138  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Arlièn Snowshade, politely.
2/19 23:16:32.047  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Good evening, Arlien.
2/19 23:16:35.876  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles to Arandell and inclines her head to the gathered in greeting: "Ishnu-alah."
2/19 23:16:56.587  Raeneya-ArgentDawn inclines her head towards the newcomer, respectfully so. "Good evening."
2/19 23:17:13.437  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles in return.
2/19 23:17:47.006  Syruné has gone offline.
2/19 23:18:01.342  Raeneya looks at Irrissia.
2/19 23:18:08.106  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hope that answered your question.
2/19 23:18:16.719  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Yes, thanks. I was just curious.
2/19 23:18:23.682  Raeneya-ArgentDawn smiles a bit and nods.
2/19 23:18:35.312  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Asking the proper questions?
2/19 23:19:06.496  Irrissia-ArgentDawn holds Ellemayne in her arms, as the fox attempts to poke Arlien. "I don't know if they are proper, but I was just curious if Sister Featherbloom planned to stay in Astranaar."
2/19 23:19:36.804  Tínwëtar-ArgentDawn orders herself a large cup of tea.
2/19 23:20:32.628  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The good old peering with "What are you doing here?" is the proper question?
2/19 23:20:47.562  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly.
2/19 23:20:48.134  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums to Ellemayne: "There you are."
2/19 23:20:53.109  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Raeneya Featherbloom. It is an honour you, Elder.
2/19 23:21:11.905  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Szonglei-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/19 23:21:12.649  Raeneya-ArgentDawn dips her head once more after introducing herself.
2/19 23:21:22.202  Arlièn-ArgentDawn looks to Raeneya and inclines her head more formally in greeting.
2/19 23:21:28.681  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] An honour to meet you, rather.
2/19 23:21:35.469  Raeneya-ArgentDawn clears her throat.
2/19 23:21:36.473  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arlièn Snowshade, the honour is mine.
2/19 23:22:02.463  Raeneya-ArgentDawn smiles and nods once.
2/19 23:23:34.464  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And I do hope Arandell did not use his way to question you about your presence here, normally he only reserves that for more unpleasant types.
2/19 23:23:55.413  You smirk slyly at Arandell.
2/19 23:24:27.722  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oi. I am pleasantly diplomatic.
2/19 23:24:33.541  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is a comfort to see that Astranaar is still managing after all these years - especially after the recent tragedies that have befallen it. And not at all. He has been nothing but a pleasure to converse with. As was Tessa.
2/19 23:25:00.495  Arlièn-ArgentDawn chuckles at Arandell and nods to Raeneya.
2/19 23:25:23.307  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We do what we can to rebuild.
2/19 23:26:08.907  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/19 23:26:17.877  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... She lacks horns and unmarked face with a smug look.
2/19 23:26:23.656  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods twice.
2/19 23:26:46.157  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Or magical abilities."
2/19 23:27:09.457  Irrissia-ArgentDawn discretly sticks her tongue out for Arandell.
2/19 23:27:11.661  Raeneya-ArgentDawn nods. "I hope that I will be able to assist in that endeavour in due time. I may have been away for a period of time, but Astranaar is my home. I cannot bear to see it wither away."
2/19 23:27:57.901  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises both of his hands as if frustrated by Tessa's comment before returning to listen the conversation.
2/19 23:28:38.356  Raeneya-ArgentDawn snickers quietly at the bickering two between Arlien, finding the little exchange amusing.
2/19 23:28:41.340  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lost her smile after Arandell gesture, tucking her head in her shoulders, hugging Ellemayne tighter
2/19 23:29:25.642  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How long have you been away for?
2/19 23:29:49.415  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks back towards Tessa and smiles as he speaks quietly. "I was not being serious."
2/19 23:30:28.746  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arandell, seemingly appeased by his words.
2/19 23:31:53.229  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slightly and then looks ahead again.
2/19 23:31:58.178  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You over at the festival there, Makhalan?
2/19 23:32:07.336  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: yes
2/19 23:32:21.774  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: How many people are there, been fun?
2/19 23:32:39.250  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I left after the defeat of the Legion's second coming. My grove was completely destroyed, and my family expressed their desire to leave Ashenvale for safety reasons and wished for me to follow, so I did. We settled in Darnassus after Teldrassil was »
2/19 23:32:41.169  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » raised off the shores of Darkshore. So... a few years past a decade now.
2/19 23:32:44.519  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: I saw a lot of people, but I'm passing some times a bit away from the crowd
2/19 23:32:54.756  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: he seemed well organized
2/19 23:33:11.503  Arandell-ArgentDawn rather discreetly eyes Tessa from the corner of his eyes.
2/19 23:33:43.201  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks down at the name of the tree, shaking slightly.
2/19 23:33:59.491  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head, eyeing the gathered.
2/19 23:34:03.584  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Dalathria.
2/19 23:34:12.327  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: He has been doing it for a very long time, so he must have picked up on a thing or two. He even did such events back before I quit
2/19 23:34:31.718  Raeneya-ArgentDawn dips her head towards the newcomer and offers a brief smile.
2/19 23:34:31.718  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Dalathria in greeting: "Ishnu-alah, Dalathria."
2/19 23:34:38.751  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: Evening, all is well?
2/19 23:34:55.582  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows silently her head for Dalathria.
2/19 23:35:06.667  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: I saw a lot of activities, some food event, a race and some kind of love game
2/19 23:35:09.802  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, Dalathria. Mostly everything is well so far.
2/19 23:35:28.921  Raeneya-ArgentDawn nods. "Evening."
2/19 23:35:45.716  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mostly? Something to be aware off?
2/19 23:36:09.229  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No. Nothing new as such.
2/19 23:36:20.850  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] For once.
2/19 23:36:26.122  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles and nods.
2/19 23:37:23.253  Dalathria-ArgentDawn nods and turns her gaze towards Raeneya. "I don't recall running into you before, recently arrived?"
2/19 23:38:19.677  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The town is small, and most will ask you that.
2/19 23:38:22.594  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums to Raeneya.
2/19 23:39:10.921  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Quite so. I've been away for a while. I returned last night. I'm Raeneya Featherbloom. It's a pleasure to meet you.
2/19 23:39:41.721  Raeneya-ArgentDawn dips her head, respectfully, after introductions.
2/19 23:40:30.623  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head slightly before he frowns.
2/19 23:40:39.922  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh there was something... Whispershot left to chase large group of horde last night. Hopefully not doing anything stupid.
2/19 23:40:45.755  Raeneya-ArgentDawn flashes a wry smirk at Tessa. "That is quite alright. I'm interested in meeting everyone and making new acquaintances and friends."
2/19 23:40:58.816  Dalathria-ArgentDawn bows her head. "Dalathria Silverleaf, good to meet you."
2/19 23:41:03.597  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Arandell.
2/19 23:41:13.730  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] By herself?
2/19 23:41:19.828  Dalathria-ArgentDawn quickly turns to Arandell. "She what now?"
2/19 23:41:39.829  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes. As reasonable as black moon ever is.
2/19 23:41:58.534  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nevermind that, how big and where?
2/19 23:42:07.527  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "Why does she do that..."
2/19 23:42:34.298  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm, that by itself not the most wise.
2/19 23:43:05.303  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nitzuss had spotted ten or more horde near the border of Ashenvale and Barrens, moving towards the forest. She did not know much more. Wisely had... ehm... Ol lizzy. *shrugs slightly* Get her out of there fast.
2/19 23:43:52.727  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: I recruited another character, I think
2/19 23:44:06.442  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do I even dare to ask? Who..?
2/19 23:44:08.075  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Oh?
2/19 23:44:31.771  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: I don't know how it happened but an arcanist fell in love with Mak and she wants to meet the Hermitage
2/19 23:44:43.204  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Ten...?"
2/19 23:44:54.352  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ...Dare I ask her name ?
2/19 23:45:01.922  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Thala
2/19 23:45:08.812  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Just Thala ?
2/19 23:45:27.399  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Who or what that is, is not likely the most important piece of information there or then I have quite failed to ask the right questions from Nitzuss.
2/19 23:45:57.350  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And the ones that you did ask?
2/19 23:46:11.478  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: the character is called Maethalana, the trp is Thala
2/19 23:46:42.053  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mostly orcs. Maybe troll or two. Armoured mounts. Did not appear instantly trying to shoot at her when she was spotted.
2/19 23:47:02.294  Raeneya-ArgentDawn folds her arms across her chest and silently listens with slightly furrowed brows of concern.
2/19 23:47:25.604  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yep, don't know her then
2/19 23:47:40.366  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is something, at least. I agree they should be tracked, but I am just not sure if Whispershot is the one to do so.
2/19 23:47:59.831  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: she is a bit shy, but good. 
2/19 23:48:07.603  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... But not heard anyone spotting them since. This was early in the evening and Whispershot left quite late at night.
2/19 23:48:25.076  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] With luck she has failed to find them.
2/19 23:48:34.099  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: We will see, then
2/19 23:48:43.074  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] With luck?
2/19 23:49:04.342  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] All this unfolded last evening?
2/19 23:49:30.515  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She may not show restraint in trying to kill one or two. No matter how good you are, over ten is quite a number to deal with.
2/19 23:50:06.293  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yet the alternative seems to be do nothing and hope for the best.
2/19 23:50:24.548  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: ? there is an issue about that?
2/19 23:51:48.802  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Trying to track them is the alternative, I suppose.
2/19 23:52:08.622  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hopefully to kill them.
2/19 23:52:43.695  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If we can gather numbers. First spotting them.
2/19 23:53:14.183  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I could take Ash'ra and patrol the borders this evening just to ensure all is well.
2/19 23:53:20.908  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So where they at? The southern border?
2/19 23:53:59.467  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No telling where they are now. That was the direction they moved from Barrens, if I understood Nitzuss correctly.
2/19 23:54:02.611  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears slightly, some nervosity washing over her features.
2/19 23:54:21.907  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They came from the border?
2/19 23:54:32.432  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She at least see which direction they were heading to?
2/19 23:55:13.042  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Towards the border of Ashenvale and Barrens from the Barrens, I belive.
2/19 23:55:46.096  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So she was in the Barrens? I have difficulty picturing the situation.
2/19 23:56:13.305  Dalathria-ArgentDawn nods. "Indeed, not sure I quite follow here."
2/19 23:56:25.358  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She was heading home from Ratchet. It was bit confusing and our rather uncalm sister did not make it less confusing.
2/19 23:57:21.189  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "That makes more sense, now."
2/19 23:58:04.421  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So, no one has seen them crossing the border?
2/19 23:59:43.506  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I assumed so...
2/20 00:00:23.009  Dalathria-ArgentDawn grunts. "That's either good or a lot worse and I'm not sure which."
2/20 00:00:24.158  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Although OC info is 20 or so horde RPing in Ashenvale. So they did, Aran just isn't really clear on the location.
2/20 00:00:59.821  Arandell-ArgentDawn gestures at Raeneya as he speaks.
2/20 00:01:22.587  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm. As the sister says, we could arrange patrol or two for the coming nights.
2/20 00:02:13.866  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We don't have the bodies for more than one. A patrol of two head is no good if we assume them to be at lest ten strong.
2/20 00:02:14.160  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Might still be good to chech in on Raynewood Tower, hear if they spotted any movement in central Ashenvale. From there arrange a patrol allong the few holdouts and the borders towards the east.
2/20 00:02:27.595  Raeneya-ArgentDawn nods. "It is better safe than suffer any unneeded consequences."
2/20 00:02:42.309  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I would be tempted to go the Nightblades, but to be honest, it sounds like they are having problems of their own.
2/20 00:02:42.964  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Were the Nightblades informed?
2/20 00:02:56.226  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not yet.
2/20 00:03:00.791  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As far as I know.
2/20 00:03:10.640  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is their issue still the same?
2/20 00:03:47.841  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] More or less. Rather crestfallen priestess and cadre trying to rally around to solve that.
2/20 00:04:14.401  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances towards the campfire.
2/20 00:04:15.476  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Even if they have trouble and if they do not already know, I think they would like to be informed.
2/20 00:04:30.817  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/20 00:04:35.959  Dalathria-ArgentDawn shakes her head grumbling. "I'm starting to need that drink..."
2/20 00:05:00.967  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Affraid you maybe correct there, elder.
2/20 00:05:35.577  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums: "Duty."
2/20 00:06:06.079  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed. Nitzuss had something else to say too regarding the ruins of Auberdine. Wants to seek your approval for the idea.
2/20 00:06:26.127  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But... shall I go inform the Nightblades first?
2/20 00:07:14.800  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I believe this takes presendence, yes.
2/20 00:07:31.166  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 00:07:42.656  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As you say.
2/20 00:08:10.303  Arandell-ArgentDawn adjusts his surcoat for a moment while looking towards the fire.
2/20 00:08:55.040  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hopefully they are not in the mood to shoot the messenger.
2/20 00:08:59.140  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly.
2/20 00:09:17.128  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "Hopefully..."
2/20 00:09:19.333  Raeneya-ArgentDawn veers her attention towards Dalathria. "Do inform me if you require assistance with the patrol, sister. I'm very familiar with Ashenvale - I used to serve here a little over a decade ago."
2/20 00:10:34.705  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will, though generally speaking the organized efforts are handled by the sentinels or possibly the hermitage. I'm simply an archer that goes where needed.
2/20 00:11:02.432  Raeneya-ArgentDawn nods. "Fair enough."
2/20 00:12:00.092  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I shall take my leave, then. I have a few things I need to tend to before dawn. It was an honour and a pleasure to meet you all.
2/20 00:12:01.276  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If the Sentinels are not able to see to such matters, you should seek out Vashira Ravenheart. She normally deals with such matters.
2/20 00:12:18.720  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Raeneya Featherbloom, politely.
2/20 00:12:35.721  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: SHe wears green gear, long dark hair and red serpent markings.
2/20 00:12:45.887  Raeneya-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I shall keep that in mind.
2/20 00:12:55.330  Raeneya-ArgentDawn smiles thinly and dips her head.
2/20 00:13:00.790  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Raeneya. "Take care sister. Goddess watch over you."
2/20 00:13:06.930  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Raeneya.
2/20 00:13:31.270  Irrissia-ArgentDawn idly strokes Ellemayne's back.
2/20 00:13:31.487  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums to Tessaemay with some amusement: "Even start to sound like me."
2/20 00:13:42.814  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: ...Do I ?
2/20 00:13:52.304  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I was about to say the same thing.
2/20 00:14:00.565  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: J-just a reflex...
2/20 00:14:03.482  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears.
2/20 00:14:17.100  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Rob. Stop giving Tessa panic attack xD ffs
2/20 00:14:41.861  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Is there anything that doesn't give her one?
2/20 00:14:50.486  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: YES ! :O
2/20 00:14:51.343  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is good to be complete, otherwise she would just be looking around.
2/20 00:15:04.673  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "B-but I can stop if it bother you..."
2/20 00:15:32.844  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not at all, as I said it is a good feature.
2/20 00:16:01.590  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly, unsure.
2/20 00:17:01.803  Uodrieth has gone offline.
2/20 00:18:34.330  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is a good trait to have. Something people often forget to do.
2/20 00:19:00.262  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles faintly. "Probably..."
2/20 00:19:09.063  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I started to study the books and the notes we found.
2/20 00:20:53.425  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "Good. I hope it will tell us something more. Winterflower has been healed, but he is very stuborn."
2/20 00:21:14.703  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well... it got worse.
2/20 00:21:57.197  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Should I go have a listen?
2/20 00:22:07.843  Dalathria-ArgentDawn slowly draws a deep breath. "They can't deal with it or worse?"
2/20 00:22:09.477  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arandell Moonsong.
2/20 00:22:16.946  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The commander asks us to send who we could spare to north. To the border of Darkshore as well.
2/20 00:22:35.269  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: What...do you mean ?
2/20 00:23:11.955  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The commander had been told of satyrs spotted there. They need to be tracked as well. And of course extra care taken when traveling there.
2/20 00:23:49.620  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And how does Darkshore connect to all this?
2/20 00:24:00.085  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Satyr's and our mysterious mages to the north, Horde to the east.
2/20 00:24:27.347  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She will inform the Silverwings of the horde and send some of her own to look for the horde as well, but both cadres spread thin.
2/20 00:24:52.799  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nervously breathes, her hands rubbing in Ellemayne fur with anxiety.
2/20 00:25:26.211  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Darkshore... not much else than the location. Up north near the border to Darkshore some satyrs spotted. No word on numbers or much more details on it.
2/20 00:26:19.070  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Right... So we have what, less than six heads available?
2/20 00:26:36.848  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And our own... thing to deal with.
2/20 00:26:53.997  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums to Dalathria: "So it does sound."
2/20 00:26:54.705  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm. Two for patrol as we speak. Well, Raven can be found for it too.
2/20 00:27:40.263  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If the damned mage is still around too, I'd start to argue that two for one patrol is not enough.
2/20 00:28:28.054  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ugh...
2/20 00:28:35.181  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 00:28:41.752  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien.
2/20 00:29:21.289  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If we can not find the rest. Just me, Dalathria and Raven, we need one more to make at least two pairs.
2/20 00:29:21.647  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien, asking shyly. "I... could try to speak with... Winterflower, m-maybe ?"
2/20 00:29:40.063  Thyreena has gone offline.
2/20 00:30:54.964  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums: "I will hear if there are any others nearby, otherwise I will join in a patroll."
2/20 00:31:01.589  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: A-and like that you can join... them ?
2/20 00:31:07.645  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 00:31:27.035  Arlièn-ArgentDawn nods to Tessaemay.
2/20 00:32:06.987  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Just be warned, he will try to convince you. I have spoken with him, but he is zealous in his conviction.
2/20 00:32:31.730  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: W-well... Kelthulus did the... same. A-and... Arandell can say... I... know how it goes.
2/20 00:32:52.330  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (I guess you prefer to RP that, btw ?)
2/20 00:33:44.300  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Tessaemay.
2/20 00:34:24.144  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would still recomend trying to have someone with you there, Tessa.
2/20 00:34:49.282  Irrissia-ArgentDawn ponders a moment, her hands nervously rubbing Ellemayne's back.
2/20 00:35:38.151  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I-...it would be safer b-but. If he... is that zealous... he won't speak if he isn't convinced... that the people in the room are... aggreeing.
2/20 00:36:24.773  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yush, that would be nice
2/20 00:36:35.552  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He will talk your ears full of maybe more distressing topic. Would simply be more for you than the questioning.
2/20 00:36:38.725  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Totally down for that too. When do you want to do it ?)
2/20 00:37:17.152  Irrissia-ArgentDawn confidence seems to flicker. She looks down a moment, processing.
2/20 00:38:29.920  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head. "N-no. I can do it."
2/20 00:38:53.606  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/20 00:39:14.811  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: hrm, could do tomorrow. But in the afternoon I will be busy with a few things.
2/20 00:39:25.536  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It... will look better if... I seem convinced anyway. *She inhales deeply*
2/20 00:39:45.934  Lyndraé has gone offline.
2/20 00:39:51.387  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He seems the type to be more free with his details if he did that, yes.
2/20 00:39:53.634  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 00:39:59.958  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Just give me an hour, and I will be here. I would HIGHLY prefer not between 15 and 18 xD Because I'm in table RP with Neiveen.)
2/20 00:40:14.636  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I simply worry... But admittedly there is a point and we are short on people for everything.
2/20 00:40:24.968  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: After 18 then, shall try early evening.
2/20 00:40:37.779  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A sign of our times.
2/20 00:40:40.450  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Zealots... usually are. I will just... lock myself in a room after. If I feel I'm drifting.
2/20 00:41:00.128  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (You're busy in the evening, that's is ?)
2/20 00:41:11.859  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: No during the day
2/20 00:41:21.454  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Then just during the evening ? xD Why not ?)
2/20 00:41:31.883  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmmhm...
2/20 00:41:49.236  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I will find you right after.
2/20 00:41:49.236  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods at Arlien and then at Tessa.
2/20 00:41:53.870  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Any... of you.
2/20 00:42:23.131  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good. Good.
2/20 00:42:28.194  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very good.
2/20 00:42:36.056  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums in agreement with Arandell.
2/20 00:43:01.691  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Still gets better. Since Nitzuss will require two people. Herself being one of the two for what she had in mind.
2/20 00:43:08.514  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: about the new player that maybe will come around Astranaar, just to be clear, I didn't invited in events or guild. She will just come and dip her toes in the city
2/20 00:43:16.715  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What did she have in mind?
2/20 00:43:33.033  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: I just told to her as usual that I'm in deep debt with Elder Snowshade, so she will probably wanted to meet Arlien
2/20 00:44:00.918  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Think Tessa just got a little defensive, we usually take our time with recruiting.
2/20 00:44:30.151  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: I know, precisely why I didn't say anything about the guild
2/20 00:44:31.507  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She brought up the supplies last night. Crates with the cartel markings. She wishes to take someone and head to Everlook see if questions and few bribes would give us more answers. Maybe the cartel is supplying others involved in that mess as well.
2/20 00:44:40.533  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: It will be cool to meet her, definitely :-) She is free to join on in for the event I am running
2/20 00:44:44.078  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: Rob, you know me. I was always very respectful of that
2/20 00:44:55.361  Syruin-ArgentDawn says: Moonberry Juice, please.
2/20 00:45:05.217  Syruin-ArgentDawn says: A paladin I courted for a while.
2/20 00:45:21.861  Vayarm-ArgentDawn raised a brow at Syruin. He then just shook his head to himself before speaking to the barkeep
2/20 00:45:32.336  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She was halfway dragging Makhalann off the fire before deciding to ask from the keeper first.
2/20 00:45:36.693  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods, weighing the advantages to the threats back at home.
2/20 00:45:40.486  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly.
2/20 00:45:45.566  Vayarm-ArgentDawn says: Aye got more of that stuff from Adron? Aye? Perfect, I'll take a bottle.
2/20 00:45:56.490  Syruin-ArgentDawn says: The Gilnean whiskey?
2/20 00:46:32.514  Vayarm-ArgentDawn fished out several silver pieces and slid them across the table, for a bottle of whiskey. The craftsmanship of the bottle implied it was of Kaldorei make. The colours and elegant pottery certainly so.
2/20 00:46:34.877  Vayarm-ArgentDawn says: I wish
2/20 00:46:51.780  Vayarm-ArgentDawn took the bottle in his grasp and turned to head up the ramp.
2/20 00:47:07.856  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Ye, I know. It could be interpetted that way so I thought I'd clarify too
2/20 00:47:46.669  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm, I hear you. We will see when she returns if the moment can allow it. We are short on able warriors it feels.
2/20 00:48:03.443  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 00:48:11.910  Syruin-ArgentDawn slid a few coins along the counter as well, fishing up a tankard of moonberry juice. "What's this then?
2/20 00:48:16.640  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: np, I wrote precisely for that
2/20 00:48:25.945  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: I know I can speak freely with you
2/20 00:48:50.233  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I like her thinking on that, but yes, it maybe something that has to wait for a night or two it seems.
2/20 00:49:10.451  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: :-) That is a big compliment, thank you.
2/20 00:49:45.209  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May I should look into calling in a few favours.
2/20 00:50:14.430  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Last time you did that you raised an army... Not certain we need that much.

2/20 00:53:29.378  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Suppose so...
2/20 00:53:48.898  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I could ask Caelir and Yvaenia...?
2/20 00:54:19.682  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Arandell and Vashira would like them, they know how discipline works, and they wear shoes.
2/20 00:54:21.379  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Caelir is here once again?
2/20 00:54:23.548  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 00:54:24.667  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/20 00:54:43.662  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: He is, yes. He... wanted to... speak. Just been a bit... too busy to see him.
2/20 00:56:02.144  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hear how that get's  them a little extra respect.
2/20 00:56:05.791  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm. Anyone will do who understand the difference between scouting and killing. We are only scouting for now.
2/20 00:56:23.837  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Yvaenia was our scout in Mandala'dor.
2/20 00:56:43.739  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Caelir is less... made for. But he did lots of patrols for the temple ?
2/20 00:56:56.380  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I do not doubt their abilities. Merely stating at the moment we are not picky. Anyone who can be mustered for tonight and possibly tomorrow.

2/20 01:00:05.849  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/20 01:00:19.496  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Vashira.
2/20 01:00:26.434  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Vashira.
2/20 01:00:32.586  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perfect. Makes two pairs at least for the later.
2/20 01:00:32.947  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune, Vashira.
2/20 01:00:47.757  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Vashira Ravenheart, politely.
2/20 01:00:53.031  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Blessed night.
2/20 01:01:01.166  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Two pairs?
2/20 01:01:55.457  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Quick brb, grabbing a drink
2/20 01:01:58.637  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Patrols to send out. At least one to track group of horde and another from the request of Nightblades to track satyrs.
2/20 01:02:45.107  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Satyrs? Again? Hm..what area of the woods?
2/20 01:03:44.504  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Returns
2/20 01:03:56.489  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Near the border of Darkshore was the satyrs. The commander had no knowledge of how many. Asked us to send who we can spare to to scout. She will send some from her cadre as well.
2/20 01:04:50.917  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And last night Nitzuss spotted ten or more horde moving near border of Ashenvale and Barrens. Not certain, if they crossed into Ashenvale.
2/20 01:04:56.582  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I see. Darkshore sure becomes a hotspot for trouble
2/20 01:05:23.522  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They are probing. Often do that, see if there is a response.
2/20 01:05:38.388  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Still something to keep an eye on
2/20 01:05:49.389  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So another patrol there to try and track down. Nightblades will inform Silverwing and if they can spare one or two of their own for it as well.
2/20 01:06:39.822  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Also Whispershot heard it and ran off to find the horde last night. Not seen her tonight.
2/20 01:06:53.888  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 01:07:36.926  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well what ever you prefer. I don't expect much trouble from the horde. They won't go attack us unless we strike first. They might send in scouts themselves or as said, send a small patrol to see how fast we react. The satyrs could become a trouble.
2/20 01:07:52.457  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/20 01:08:57.886  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Too large group to not at least track or make certain they did not enter, if you ask me. And yes, not to ignore the satyrs or the request for help.
2/20 01:09:04.172  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Really not the time or a matter to rely on expactations.
2/20 01:09:55.778  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Just saying what ever he prefers to look into. I'm fine with what ever I'm send too
2/20 01:10:57.245  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Both. We have two pairs, if we drag the poor elder away from her chores.
2/20 01:11:22.734  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And if Tessa can muster us one pair more tonight or tomorrow.
2/20 01:13:35.273  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Is Caelir in the New Leaf chat?
2/20 01:13:41.531  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Yep, Yva is too
2/20 01:13:49.223  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Both in Guests
2/20 01:13:51.704  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Euh wait
2/20 01:13:57.687  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Not sure for Yva, actually
2/20 01:14:10.582  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Yes, she is
2/20 01:14:12.026  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: I checked
2/20 01:14:14.517  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Both in Guests
2/20 01:14:38.648  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So..who form what pair
2/20 01:14:53.753  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yet to be decided.
2/20 01:15:42.229  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'll go with Arandell to the border with the Barrens. There may or may not be Horde there.
2/20 01:16:04.097  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Buy Yva  ain't in the ingame community, is he?
2/20 01:16:14.524  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Probably not
2/20 01:16:39.565  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Guess we are after the Satyr then
2/20 01:16:55.427  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Becoming a habbit at this point...
2/20 01:17:10.527  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well atleast you have the experience *chuckles*
2/20 01:17:23.080  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, indeed.
2/20 01:17:34.839  Frolbar has come online.
2/20 01:17:50.448  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You prefer to handle the border with the barrens?
2/20 01:17:51.330  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm. Although request was to track and scout. Not attack.

2/20 01:18:56.039  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'd rather kill them on sight. So the satyr might be safer option.
2/20 01:19:50.982  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] One or two you might be able to handle. But two dozen?
2/20 01:20:14.093  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Right, the diplomatic patrol to the horde and more stabby one towards satyrs.
2/20 01:20:39.479  Vashíra-ArgentDawn smirks
2/20 01:23:01.689  Thyreena has come online.
2/20 01:23:20.286  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: And someone remind me to poke Tin tomorrow that we actually sent two people.
2/20 01:23:43.800  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So, did the commander give any further orders or requests?
2/20 01:23:45.195  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Will try
2/20 01:23:47.606  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And if we find nothing, suppose we can assume more or less same patrols tomorrow.
2/20 01:24:17.370  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perhaps replacing elder for someone with less chores, if possible.
2/20 01:24:34.904  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Noted.
2/20 01:24:37.203  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What?
2/20 01:25:05.207  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And no, simply to assist in trying to locate the satyrs and confirm more or less the area where.
2/20 01:25:15.716  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I even put an event in my calendar
2/20 01:25:18.067  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Just for you.
2/20 01:25:27.014  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: I feel speciual.
2/20 01:25:43.507  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I think we have things for that, let me take a look
2/20 01:25:50.767  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No location?
2/20 01:26:02.091  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Other than the broder.

2/20 01:26:31.943  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No. Large area. That is why she asked help. But she is sending Nightblades to scout as well.
2/20 01:26:48.670  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And where do we meet up?
2/20 01:27:35.445  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No meeting place. Suppose we are doing it separately from them. Just do not put arrows into anyone with long ears and no hooves.
2/20 01:28:01.830  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I can make a guild anouncement, but no community anouncement :-(
2/20 01:28:11.876  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That is... going to cost us time.
2/20 01:28:47.410  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Hmm... I foresee most from the hermitage whispering me to poke Tin.
2/20 01:29:09.334  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Hold  my beer
2/20 01:29:52.097  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Here.
2/20 01:30:02.695  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Open your NL chat windows.
2/20 01:30:05.199  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not ideal for the night, but they were quite in the middle of some other chaos as well.
2/20 01:30:14.074  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: :D
2/20 01:30:45.545  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well then...
2/20 01:30:49.101  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I think we can improve that

2/20 01:31:20.786  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Remind me not to ask you for help again to remember.
2/20 01:31:23.736  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, I get that. But separate scouting parties with no communication is going to end up spending time covering the same area... Make do with what we have I guess.
2/20 01:31:30.097  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Awh come on :p
2/20 01:31:44.060  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well we just have to start somewhere and go from there for a few hours before returning.  Would have been nice to know what sectors the Sentinels were covering so we don't look in the same area, but it is as it is.
2/20 01:31:44.298  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: AHAHAHHA YOU MADE AN EVENT
2/20 01:32:25.007  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Concider it checking the area twice, in case one misses tracks.
2/20 01:32:25.007  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Rob ?
2/20 01:32:29.565  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Hmm?
2/20 01:32:35.590  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Can I address the fact that the OOC rules of the hermitage are :
2/20 01:32:38.714  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "Don't be a dick" ?
2/20 01:32:48.727  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: What if your name is Dick?
2/20 01:33:01.847  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: We have OOC rules?
2/20 01:33:08.995  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Well, seems we do ? xD
2/20 01:33:21.804  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Guild Info ?
2/20 01:33:27.445  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: How can you not know...????
2/20 01:33:37.407  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: xD 
2/20 01:33:51.135  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I must have updated that, because it does have discord instead of KRP forums in it
2/20 01:34:04.257  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yes. That's why I'm confused.
2/20 01:34:05.957  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Are you sure you just don't want like my phonenumber and spamm call whatsup or something for like 3 hours tomorrow? :P
2/20 01:34:15.972  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I mean.

2/20 01:34:20.182  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: If you insist.
2/20 01:34:29.117  Uodrieth has come online.
2/20 01:34:35.891  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Can confirm, Irrissia is very good at that
2/20 01:34:55.827  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: AND IT WORKED.
2/20 01:35:01.006  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You finally posted that planning.
2/20 01:35:02.340  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: SO ?
2/20 01:35:10.961  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Great succes
2/20 01:35:23.519  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Well time for me to go. Goodnight all!
2/20 01:35:25.081  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (And he aggreed with being harassed ! I asked multiple time if I should stop)
2/20 01:35:29.381  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'll go grab my stuff. 
2/20 01:35:30.794  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Ninight Vash !
2/20 01:35:33.744  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Vashira Ravenheart, politely.
2/20 01:35:36.811  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/20 01:35:41.805  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: May Aessina watches over you.
2/20 01:35:43.491  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Vashíra: "Good hunting."
2/20 01:35:49.143  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May the goddess watch over your all, and see you in a moment Dalathria
2/20 01:35:49.607  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Vashira.
2/20 01:35:54.010  [9. Community:159037872:1] Makhalann-ArgentDawn: night vash
2/20 01:35:57.142  [9. Community:159037872:1] Makhalann-ArgentDawn: sleep well
2/20 01:35:57.807  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good hunting.
2/20 01:36:06.078  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: G'night!
2/20 01:36:13.242  Vashíra has gone offline.
2/20 01:36:30.677  Uodrieth has gone offline.
2/20 01:37:08.044  Arandell-ArgentDawn sighs quietly.
2/20 01:37:30.045  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, that did take quite a turn from greeting a new face...
2/20 01:38:19.329  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arandell Moonsong.
2/20 01:38:31.563  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: We didn't have anything better to do tonight, before Arlien arrive...
2/20 01:38:51.294  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods to Arandell: "We should not forget to include her in the patrols."
2/20 01:39:59.329  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... unfortunately she left before. Would have freed you for your chores instead.
2/20 01:40:16.261  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at Tessa and nods.
2/20 01:40:57.786  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It was a good welcome for someone returning. Merely pointed out I did not quite expect needing more people to patrol two locations.
2/20 01:41:18.721  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] With rather short notice.
2/20 01:41:28.081  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles briefly.
2/20 01:41:45.265  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly.

2/20 01:42:41.442  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I suppose you will simply enjoy the excuse to run around the forest as a stalking saber, hmmm, Arlien?
2/20 01:43:02.439  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As a stalking saber?
2/20 01:43:53.247  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Those are skills to maintain as well. And when I am not with you, I prefer to hunt and sleep in that form.
2/20 01:44:25.542  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ...Right. For some reason I keep forgetting about that.
2/20 01:44:28.676  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She is worryingly keen on being cute kitten.
2/20 01:44:33.189  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly.
2/20 01:45:25.816  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Frankly I find it rather wierd when the alternative is being a bird and flying freely.
2/20 01:45:37.915  Irrissia-ArgentDawn discretly moves a little away from Arlien. Just in case...
2/20 01:45:49.473  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Oh yeah.... :D
2/20 01:47:46.005  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is the first form I learned. It is something that stays with you, even if you learn to balance it with the other spirits.
2/20 01:48:30.271  Arandell-ArgentDawn ponders for a moment and then nods at Arlien.
2/20 01:48:40.482  Thyraleth has gone offline.
2/20 01:49:55.354  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And I rather not start kneading you while still half asleep.
2/20 01:50:19.634  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow slightly.
2/20 01:51:21.835  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Why would you... Remind me to keep armor on, if you sleep near me in that form.

2/20 01:52:51.399  Arandell-ArgentDawn peers at Arlien for a moment.
2/20 01:52:52.034  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances left, slightly terrified by the idea.
2/20 01:53:08.072  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Has that been a common issue in the past?
2/20 01:54:04.504  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, I do not sleep in that form when close to others.
2/20 01:54:11.074  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 01:55:02.406  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Rather curious...
2/20 01:55:58.861  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: So... We are making Tessa distressed by talking about Arlien doing cute cat things while sleeping in the kitty form?
2/20 01:56:53.810  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is it? I prefer to keep my humanoid instincts, and this form doesn't shed anywhere near as much fur.
2/20 01:58:20.821  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Cute cat things" Kneading with 5inch nails
2/20 01:58:58.010  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: And the answer to your question Aran is :
2/20 01:58:59.410  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yes.
2/20 01:58:59.410  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, it is certainly better this way. Does sound bit contradicting with prefering it when alone.
2/20 01:59:01.810  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Any sort of cat
2/20 01:59:04.343  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Stress Tessa.
2/20 01:59:13.943  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Even Laira's cat, she is not exactly super serene next to it
2/20 01:59:40.865  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes, but even Aran keeps distance to Mauler.
2/20 02:00:15.188  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: It's actually inspired by my own arachnophobia IRL. Tessa is especially phobic of the sabers BUT other felines stress her, and the idea of them, or picture/sounds can trigger fear reaction.
2/20 02:00:57.521  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Different situations, different preferences.
2/20 02:01:02.867  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Although the difference is arachnids are creepy crawlies and sabers not. :P
2/20 02:01:23.600  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh, I see what you mean now.
2/20 02:01:28.700  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 02:02:22.778  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Does raise another point, but one for a different, less busy times.
2/20 02:03:35.770  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly. "If we see such times."
2/20 02:03:42.768  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm, fair point. I think I will go prepare for that patrol.
2/20 02:04:13.487  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I knew someone who had a massive phobia of cats.
2/20 02:04:17.233  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: So, eh.
2/20 02:04:31.826  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well, I do realise it is called phobia for a reason. :)
2/20 02:04:33.598  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: is quite tired, so will go get some sleep
2/20 02:04:40.737  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Sure sure
2/20 02:04:44.305  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Should do the same xD
2/20 02:05:03.970  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: For once I managed to get to bed every night before 3am for 6 days ! I should keep oging...
2/20 02:05:05.437  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... Suppose I will do as well.
2/20 02:05:50.344  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and nods to Arandell.
2/20 02:06:01.048  [9. Community:159037872:1] Makhalann-ArgentDawn: sleep well Rob, have a good night
2/20 02:06:33.178  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We will meet again come nightfall, Elune look over your endeavours.
2/20 02:06:51.900  Dalathria-ArgentDawn bows her head. "Goddess watch over."
2/20 02:07:05.547  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Dalathria and then at Tessa.
2/20 02:07:09.214  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Arlièn Snowshade, politely.
2/20 02:07:14.631  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head in farewell.
2/20 02:07:15.894  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Aessina provides, Arlien.
2/20 02:07:16.727  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good hunting and may Her light guide.

2/20 21:17:01.462  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Am I coming to Ashenvale or I stay here ?
2/20 21:17:03.120  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower is kept on the bottomfloor, a sentinel nearby keeping a close eye on him.
2/20 21:17:28.733  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (I have my answeeer)
2/20 21:17:49.937  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (FFS IT'S YOU. You scared me xD)
2/20 21:19:51.413  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay gently places Ellemayne on the ground, before entering. A simple indication given to the fox : Find someone if something bad happens. She inhales deeply, before pushing the door to enter in the room.*
2/20 21:21:31.356  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower looks up, his lip is torn and he has a few bruises on his face. It seems that though the Elder may have treated him gently, the watcher have not been as gentle.
2/20 21:22:39.022  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay recovers  a bread and an apple from her bag, before walking closer, placing them on the table in front of the mage.* "Elder Snowshade said you would be hungry..."
2/20 21:24:20.028  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 21:24:48.637  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower looks to you wish suspicion, but he takes the bread anyway. The chains rattle as he reaches out and tears a piece of from the loaf.
2/20 21:25:33.340  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She joins her hands slowly, her large sleeves easily hidding her fingers.* "I'm... sorry. For the lightning."
2/20 21:27:52.027  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *Winterflower looks up:* "It was..unexpected. I did not took you for one versed witht the Arcane." He slowly bites down another piece of bread as he looks Tessaemay over.*
2/20 21:28:29.266  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I usually don't...show it. It's frown upon, even... to this night.
2/20 21:29:02.814  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "It is a gift. One we can use to do much good."
2/20 21:29:35.890  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: My mother used to say it was a birthright. And no one should told us what to do with it.
2/20 21:29:45.056  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/20 21:30:01.484  Irrissia-ArgentDawn sighs slowly, resting against the bench as she looks away, vulnerable. "But. It was long ago..."
2/20 21:30:46.861  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Hah! Sounds like one of the old guard. I am sure she would approve."
2/20 21:31:22.889  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shrugs slowly. "I don't know. She is dead, anyway..."
2/20 21:31:33.563  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks at her feet, saddened.
2/20 21:32:47.841  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Did she die at Teldrassil as well?" *Winterflower actually seems to show some compasion, through the bruises and torn lip.*
2/20 21:33:46.506  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head. "No. After. They said she did... crimes. But no one ever told me what. Wardens aren't... talkative."
2/20 21:34:16.336  Irrissia-ArgentDawn idly plays with a pebble, pushing it with her right foot, her eyes more or less focused on it.
2/20 21:34:30.603  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/20 21:35:25.555  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "That I can confirm! All they do is tell me to shut up. But for which crime? That they do not say."
2/20 21:35:59.098  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Elder Snowshade said you wanted to change the past...
2/20 21:36:08.431  Irrissia-ArgentDawn slowly looks at the mage, unsure.
2/20 21:36:27.131  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 21:37:25.491  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Don't you?" *Winterflower looks to Tessaemay, narrowing his eyes.*  "And in her stead, they sent a youngster?" * He snorts derisevly.*
2/20 21:37:55.812  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her eyes again, before glancing at the door. "I shouldn't be here..."
2/20 21:39:45.209  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Well. why don;t you get us both out of here?" *He chuckles over his bad joke.*
2/20 21:41:11.371  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head vividly, as if she was offended by the idea. "I-I... would never do that."
2/20 21:42:49.669  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I-it's just... Arlien think... I... I shouldn't be... too exposed. I have... to go.
2/20 21:43:00.240  Irrissia-ArgentDawn turns slightly, as if she was really about to leave.
2/20 21:43:19.055  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *Winterflower grins with a wicked smirk. He eats the bread, and reaches out to the apple.* "Hmm, thank you for the bread, and the apple."
2/20 21:43:46.830  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "I should not forget my manners." *He bows his head slightly to you.*
2/20 21:44:08.262  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly and takes a couple of step to reach the door, placing her hand on the frame, taking a pause. She mutters faintly, her eyes slowly glancing to him. "B-but... is it true ? Could you... really... avoid it ?"
2/20 21:45:42.315  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "We could. We can." *He looks around for a moment.* "Would you not want it?"
2/20 21:46:56.070  Irrissia-ArgentDawn faintly nods, almost imperceptly, as if she was trying to hide her reaction.
2/20 21:48:56.996  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *Winterflower ponders for a moment.* "What would you do to get it all back?"
2/20 21:50:08.595  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances around, muttering. "All... entierly ? With... the people ?"
2/20 21:51:26.271  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "If we get the calculations right...It can be done."
2/20 21:52:16.024  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters nervously. "It's... not right..."
2/20 21:53:19.742  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "IT IS NOT RIGHT IT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE! We only seek to set it right, and he will get it done."
2/20 21:53:55.503  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears, her grap on the door frame strenghtening when Winterflower screams, her eyes betraying a glimmer of panic and intense fear.
2/20 21:55:05.190  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower slammed his fist on the table, a few Sentinels attracted to the door. They look to you to see if everything is in order.

2/20 21:55:38.006  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 21:56:20.530  Irrissia-ArgentDawn displays a very polite smile to the sentinels, not lowering her mask yet, looking slightly distressed. She gently speaks to them. "It's... a-alright. W-we... are just... discussing."
2/20 21:57:14.271  [4. xtensionxtooltip2] Llilíth-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/20 21:57:27.572  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The sentinels nod, and return to their post. They stay close by and alert.
2/20 21:59:43.525  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales deeply and walks slightly closer, to keep her ton low, avoiding the sentinels to hear her. "Even if... it could... be done. The others... they made themselves sure it wouldn't happen."
2/20 22:00:39.515  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower scowls"
2/20 22:01:30.621  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Fools. We bring our loved ones back and they seek to stop us?"
2/20 22:02:54.770  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears, looking down, unsure. "I... I'm sure they... know what they do. M-maybe... the price is too high ? M-maybe it was... it was..." She stops, her voice breaking when she forces to finish her sentence, in a genuine feeling of distress. »
2/20 22:02:54.999  Irrissia-ArgentDawn » "...mean to... happen."
2/20 22:04:15.969  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower growls: "Then we are meant to undo it. The price is worth paying"
2/20 22:05:02.744  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances behind her shoulders at the sentinels, as if she was doing something wrong. She mutters even lower. "But... what... would it be ? The price."
2/20 22:07:32.316  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: The spell will require power, and the bronze will need to be held at bay.
2/20 22:08:07.771  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears a little more, reluctant. "B-but they... won't... die ? Right ?"
2/20 22:09:47.712  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Maybe. It doesn't have to be so. We do not want them to die. They just need to let us do what must be done."
2/20 22:10:20.042  Irrissia-ArgentDawn gets one step closer, lowering her voice again. "They... don't... want to help you, currently ?"
2/20 22:11:12.826  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower shakes his head to Irrissia: "No, they do not."
2/20 22:11:49.803  Irrissia-ArgentDawn seems clearly unsure of her next sentence after Winterflower answers, her eyes glancing to the door, giving him some time to add something else.
2/20 22:13:58.084  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Do you want to help?" *Winterflower says softly*
2/20 22:14:41.892  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Winterflower, her jaw shaking slightly from the tension. "M-me ? I couldn't... Can't... Wouldn't... even know where to start..."
2/20 22:14:42.502  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Undo all the death that has been caused, make sure our people are whole again?"
2/20 22:15:09.208  Irrissia-ArgentDawn eyes seems to shine brighter at that idea, however.
2/20 22:16:35.525  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "I am certain things were taken from the research site. Sent it to Everlook, to the Snowplow with my name. They will see it delivered to the right people."
2/20 22:17:15.777  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "The work is what is most important. He needs those notes, the equipment is only secondary."
2/20 22:17:16.058  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks at the door, and take a step closer, whispering.
2/20 22:17:57.743  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers : "My friends... they plan to... go there. Find the Everlook. They... would find the notes before."
2/20 22:18:16.477  Irrissia-ArgentDawn *Find the Snowplow
2/20 22:19:50.950  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: They might. Better act swiftly then, the snowplow are only mercenaries. They deliver some muscle.
2/20 22:20:46.226  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at the door nervously, muttering lowly. "B-but if they... find the notes there... They will know I helped you..."
2/20 22:22:57.940  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower frowns: "That is a good point. He needs that information though."
2/20 22:23:34.440  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Return it to where you found. Dliever another spark of that lightning of yours. It should grab the attention of the others still there."
2/20 22:24:11.081  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods discretly. She frequently glances to the door, before asking in low voice again. "Others...? L-like gobelins o-or...?"
2/20 22:26:09.302  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: " No, the others at the observatory..." *He frowns for a moment looking to the door, suddenly more suspisious again.*
2/20 22:27:04.033  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks at the door again, as he glances, clearly ready to move if anyone went too close to see her muttering with the mage. Like a child, caught in the middle of something not suppose to be done.
2/20 22:30:47.404  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Summerbreeze is there at Willowsheart hehest, she will see it through. Just leave it back at Auberdine."
2/20 22:31:41.119  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Hehest ?)
2/20 22:32:05.907  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: (behest*)
2/20 22:32:33.134  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly, muttering. "Do... I- say... anyting about you ?"
2/20 22:33:35.808  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "They likely know already. Don't mind me, the work must continue."
2/20 22:33:58.843  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly, unsure.
2/20 22:34:50.445  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I-... I need to be... discret. *She mutters again.* The others... They... They won't let me leave alone without... suspicions.
2/20 22:35:30.545  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "You seem to be a clever girl. You can figure it out."
2/20 22:36:10.289  Irrissia-ArgentDawn swallows hardly. "I will... do my best."
2/20 22:38:29.935  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *The sound at the door anounces a Sentinel, who peaks around the door to check if everything is still going alright."
2/20 22:38:51.610  Irrissia-ArgentDawn straightens and steps back, looking at the sentinels, her ears slightly lowered, as if she has been caught in action.
2/20 22:40:15.603  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I...wanted to be sure the chains weren't... dammaging his wrists.
2/20 22:40:34.404  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Everything still alright here? Do not let him weasel his way out of them."
2/20 22:42:51.224  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head vividly. "No, no. Elder Snowshade wanted to be sure h-he was healing well."
2/20 22:43:03.791  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: For... for the futur interogatorry.

2/20 22:46:05.568  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "Y-yes. Thanks you." She heads to the door, with a discret glance for the mage.

2/20 21:15:44.655  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, elder.
2/20 21:15:48.957  Telariel-ArgentDawn bows her head to Arlien.
2/20 21:16:01.636  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Blessed evening, Sister.
2/20 21:16:03.446  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods at Ialluen.
2/20 21:16:09.293  Dungeon Difficulty set to Heroic.
2/20 21:16:09.311  You have invited Delnaram to join your group.
2/20 21:16:12.055  Delnaram joins the party.
2/20 21:16:14.629  You have invited Irrissia to join your group.
2/20 21:16:20.211  Irrissia joins the party.
2/20 21:16:20.239  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So it indeed seems to be most of the time.
2/20 21:16:25.763  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Blessed eve, sister.
2/20 21:17:01.457  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Am I coming to Ashenvale or I stay here ?
2/20 21:17:03.091  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower is kept on the bottomfloor, a sentinel nearby keeping a close eye on him.
2/20 21:17:28.735  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (I have my answeeer)
2/20 21:17:49.904  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (FFS IT'S YOU. You scared me xD)
2/20 21:18:08.035  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: Even more issues to deal with?
2/20 21:18:14.776  Iâlluen looks at you.
2/20 21:19:07.739  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not... so far.
2/20 21:19:18.472  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] All in due time
2/20 21:19:51.351  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay gently places Ellemayne on the ground, before entering. A simple indication given to the fox : Find someone if something bad happens. She inhales deeply, before pushing the door to enter in the room.*
2/20 21:19:51.985  Arandell-ArgentDawn sips from his cup slowly.
2/20 21:20:09.945  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hopefully when we have our current ones resolved to some extend.
2/20 21:20:25.977  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Wich one of them...
2/20 21:20:29.943  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly.
2/20 21:20:40.079  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You seem to have enough to do.
2/20 21:20:41.356  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Most, prefferably?
2/20 21:21:31.234  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower looks up, his lip is torn and he has a few bruises on his face. It seems that though the Elder may have treated him gently, the watcher have not been as gentle.
2/20 21:22:30.969  Thyraleth has come online.
2/20 21:22:38.936  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay recovers  a bread and an apple from her bag, before walking closer, placing them on the table in front of the mage.* "Elder Snowshade said you would be hungry..."
2/20 21:22:45.837  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... Well, fortunately not all if it desperately urgent.
2/20 21:23:16.309  Nifre has gone offline.
2/20 21:23:29.802  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Priorities, by the sound of it.
2/20 21:24:20.105  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 21:24:29.772  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed. Horde and satyrs in Ashenvale seem the most pressing ones.
2/20 21:24:31.737  Loralyn-ArgentDawn approached the bar, ordering herself a moonberry juice. She'd sip from it when it arrives, looking down the line of others.
2/20 21:24:48.640  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower looks to you wish suspicion, but he takes the bread anyway. The chains rattle as he reaches out and tears a piece of from the loaf.
2/20 21:24:57.007  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Brother, sisters.
2/20 21:24:59.429  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Loralyn.
2/20 21:25:04.339  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Some of our own went to help with tracking down the Horde. They haven't reported back anything as of yet.
2/20 21:25:05.793  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn nods in greeting.
2/20 21:25:14.110  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Loralyn.
2/20 21:25:17.440  Telariel-ArgentDawn bows her head to Loralyn.
2/20 21:25:25.452  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: We didn't find anything yet either, right?
2/20 21:25:33.341  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She joins her hands slowly, her large sleeves easily hidding her fingers.* "I'm... sorry. For the lightning."
2/20 21:25:54.866  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: No. As far as I know they are not in Ashenvale anymore.
2/20 21:26:01.781  Dalathria has come online.
2/20 21:26:02.763  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It sounds as if trouble is rearing its head again.
2/20 21:26:42.095  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... We did not find them either last night.
2/20 21:26:43.687  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn huffs
2/20 21:26:46.800  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When isn't it?
2/20 21:27:04.396  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm. A good enough point.
2/20 21:27:52.031  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *Winterflower looks up:* "It was..unexpected. I did not took you for one versed witht the Arcane." He slowly bites down another piece of bread as he looks Tessaemay over.*
2/20 21:28:11.520  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Scared em away!
2/20 21:28:16.531  Arandell-ArgentDawn takes another sip from his cup.
2/20 21:28:40.186  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn sighs softly, sipping her tea.
2/20 21:29:02.821  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "It is a gift. One we can use to do much good."
2/20 21:29:09.666  Tharandrél has come online.
2/20 21:29:29.612  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Speaking of nothing Moonseeker, is there anything that needs to be written into the journal after last night?
2/20 21:29:32.643  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Or they did some short thing and not sticking around, but I will try to have sometime tomorrow to fly around, if there is any. Just to have the OC knowledge on it. Not that we can do much to it anyways. :P
2/20 21:29:37.998  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and asks Nantar for a cup of tea as well, waiting a moment before it is ready.
2/20 21:29:45.041  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/20 21:29:49.761  Loralyn-ArgentDawn takes another drink from her moonberry.
2/20 21:30:09.034  Dalathria has gone offline.
2/20 21:30:28.466  Iâlluen looks at Telariel.
2/20 21:30:43.367  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will admit I am not entirely sure what happened to the Captain, I was a little more focused on keeping us all safe.
2/20 21:30:46.865  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Hah! Sounds like one of the old guard. I am sure she would approve."
2/20 21:31:04.668  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As for myself, just exhaustion really. Nothing unusual there.
2/20 21:31:36.071  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very well. How are you recovering from that?
2/20 21:31:41.770  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Was there combat last night? No major injuries i'd hope.
2/20 21:31:48.006  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If you are comfortable talking about it, of course.
2/20 21:32:01.242  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If you wish, we can go elsewhere if you would rather not.
2/20 21:32:02.774  Iâlluen looks at Telariel.
2/20 21:32:47.521  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It was not quite combat, more some of walking into a trap. None of us were injured severely.
2/20 21:32:47.822  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Did she die at Teldrassil as well?" *Winterflower actually seems to show some compasion, through the bruises and torn lip.*
2/20 21:33:00.106  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head slightly.
2/20 21:33:12.067  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A trap? That's.. concerning.
2/20 21:33:19.233  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Any idea who set it?
2/20 21:33:32.099  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn fidgets with a bracelet.
2/20 21:34:09.166  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 21:34:11.168  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A foe we made the mistake of not finishing off in the past. They will not escape this time.
2/20 21:34:30.567  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/20 21:34:53.102  Thyreena has come online.
2/20 21:35:02.434  Tharandrél has gone offline.
2/20 21:35:23.799  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah. Well if you require an extra pair of hands, i'm certainly willing to help.
2/20 21:35:25.399  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "That I can confirm! All they do is tell me to shut up. But for which crime? That they do not say."
2/20 21:35:34.980  Loralyn-ArgentDawn smiled slightly, nodding her head before drinking again.
2/20 21:36:27.162  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 21:36:52.163  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn sips her tea.
2/20 21:37:07.934  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] While the offer is appreciated Sister this foe is rather cunning. We know many of her tricks and would not wish for others to get caught in her schemes.
2/20 21:37:25.497  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Don't you?" *Winterflower looks to Tessaemay, narrowing his eyes.*  "And in her stead, they sent a youngster?" * He snorts derisevly.*
2/20 21:37:45.191  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Past that... we are still awaiting more information. We do not know as much as we want to at the moment regardless.
2/20 21:37:56.373  Telariel-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 21:38:04.874  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Of course.
2/20 21:38:39.608  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I hope you can bring a swift end to the problem then.
2/20 21:38:47.417  Thyraleth has gone offline.
2/20 21:38:53.875  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My main occupation is currently trying to catch up on rest.
2/20 21:38:58.941  Telariel-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 21:39:03.942  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I would be delighted if matters could stop getting in the way of that.
2/20 21:39:08.474  Arandell-ArgentDawn drinks what remains in his cup and sets it on the counter.
2/20 21:39:45.227  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Well. why don;t you get us both out of here?" *He chuckles over his bad joke.*
2/20 21:40:43.036  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and accepts the tea fron Nantar, blowing over the hot liquid before she takes a carefull sip.
2/20 21:40:51.939  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn sips her tea.
2/20 21:40:58.139  Loralyn-ArgentDawn takes another drink from her juice, sighing slightly.
2/20 21:41:07.805  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn peeks outside.
2/20 21:41:12.206  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Oh. A moment...
2/20 21:42:05.103  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn returns looking very confused. In her palm lies a stone. 
2/20 21:42:13.419  Loralyn raises her eyebrow inquisitively at Iâlluen.
2/20 21:42:16.326  You raise your eyebrow inquisitively at Iâlluen.
2/20 21:42:17.439  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I got mail, apparently.
2/20 21:42:27.533  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn holds out the stone. 
2/20 21:42:29.100  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ..And is that a Moonstone?
2/20 21:42:31.499  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] From who?
2/20 21:42:37.599  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is just a common stone.
2/20 21:43:07.699  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Right...
2/20 21:43:11.799  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hrm.
2/20 21:43:14.098  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow slightly.
2/20 21:43:16.766  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I... wonder if it came with a note. I should have looked.
2/20 21:43:18.901  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *Winterflower grins with a wicked smirk. He eats the bread, and reaches out to the apple.* "Hmm, thank you for the bread, and the apple."
2/20 21:43:20.432  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ...Hold on.
2/20 21:43:23.100  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is this what those humans call...junk mail or something?
2/20 21:43:46.833  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "I should not forget my manners." *He bows his head slightly to you.*
2/20 21:43:47.933  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn returns with the note.
2/20 21:44:07.625  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] "This stone is solid and smooth and it made me think of you."
2/20 21:44:20.291  Telariel-ArgentDawn looks even more confused.
2/20 21:44:27.291  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn blushes. Noteworthy is that her player did not make this up, she legit got sent a stone.
2/20 21:44:47.394  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Didn't your "admirer" meet his end already?
2/20 21:44:52.725  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sounds something Gweryan would end up saying...
2/20 21:45:01.792  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn looks between the very ordinary stone and the strange, unsigned note.
2/20 21:45:42.193  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "We could. We can." *He looks around for a moment.* "Would you not want it?"
2/20 21:45:45.426  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ...Why am I being sent pebbles?
2/20 21:45:52.845  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Surely this must have been sent to the wrong person?
2/20 21:46:02.478  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is there no name on the note?
2/20 21:46:03.313  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I have no clue. Maybe it is Annaeya playing tricks?
2/20 21:46:54.965  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn hands Telariel the stone.
2/20 21:47:44.561  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It does sound similar to her kind of tricks, though she would normally just leave it among your belongings.
2/20 21:48:07.673  Telariel-ArgentDawn takes the stone, giving it a quick look over.
2/20 21:48:18.644  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] This is a bit too much on the advanced side even for her.
2/20 21:48:37.005  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn sighs.
2/20 21:48:44.906  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Why cannot I ever have just a calm, normal night?
2/20 21:48:47.208  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Should at least be happy that it would seem mostly harmless problem to have added to whatever there already is.
2/20 21:48:57.007  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *Winterflower ponders for a moment.* "What would you do to get it all back?"
2/20 21:49:09.762  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Strange things do seem to just.. gravitate toward you, Ia.
2/20 21:49:17.060  Telariel-ArgentDawn shrugs faintly.
2/20 21:50:17.196  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn gives Loralyn a look before she returns her attention to Arandell.
2/20 21:50:30.487  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am unsure it is a problem even.
2/20 21:50:43.486  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, even better then.
2/20 21:50:48.179  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods and smiles.
2/20 21:51:24.478  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'd get rid of the stone, just in case. You never know.
2/20 21:51:26.212  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "If we get the calculations right...It can be done."
2/20 21:51:55.381  Gwydhienne has gone offline.
2/20 21:52:20.991  Telariel-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 21:52:33.093  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It... is just a stone, sister. Not everything is murder, horrors, curses and fel. 
2/20 21:52:40.659  Loralyn-ArgentDawn shrugs.
2/20 21:52:49.128  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The pebble could well have originated from the paths outside.
2/20 21:53:04.930  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks towards Arlien.
2/20 21:53:19.729  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "IT IS NOT RIGHT IT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE! We only seek to set it right, and he will get it done."
2/20 21:53:36.622  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perhaps. But do you really need something else keeping you from rest?
2/20 21:53:57.073  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Although that does remind me of something. I will go find Auris for it and come back in just a brief moment.
2/20 21:54:24.688  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and raises an eyebrow to Arandell. She smiles and nods:"Ofcourse."
2/20 21:54:40.998  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am confused, sister. Not introduced to yet another problem I have to deal with.
2/20 21:54:45.131  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods at Arlen and then dips his head towards the others around the counter.
2/20 21:54:47.164  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn both looks and sounds tired.
2/20 21:55:05.203  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower slammed his fist on the table, a few Sentinels attracted to the door. They look to you to see if everything is in order.
2/20 21:55:08.872  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: I really need a new keyboard soon.
2/20 21:55:34.922  FRIEND_ONLINE
2/20 21:55:38.079  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 21:55:40.356  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Is that what Auris is briging?
2/20 21:55:45.343  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Also need to brew some coffee.
2/20 21:56:00.706  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: I wish. :P
2/20 21:56:08.772  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Anyways, 5 mins afk.
2/20 21:56:19.606  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perhaps we should get you back to the outpost for now then.
2/20 21:56:33.405  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You look terrible, Ia. I have to agree with Telariel, you need to rest.
2/20 21:57:14.282  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Llilíth-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/20 21:57:18.504  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I do not really know what you think of me these days, but seeing you like this is disheartening.
2/20 21:57:27.565  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The sentinels nod, and return to their post. They stay close by and alert.
2/20 21:57:27.565  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn gives Loralyn a dry look. That clearly did not sit well with her. 
2/20 21:57:44.938  Loralyn-ArgentDawn drinks from her moonberry.
2/20 21:57:55.875  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Rest assured that telling me that I look terrible perhaps does not improve my view of you sister, but thank you for the.... concern, shall I call it?
2/20 21:58:10.904  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is concern, yes.
2/20 21:58:20.056  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] ..Worded poorly, but concern all the same.
2/20 21:58:32.811  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed. 
2/20 21:58:37.385  Iâlluen looks at Telariel.
2/20 21:58:41.514  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Lead the way, Moonseeker.
2/20 21:58:49.591  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn picks up her cup from the counter.
2/20 21:58:59.937  Telariel-ArgentDawn nods.
2/20 21:59:08.966  Loralyn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goddess guide you both. May She guard your rest.
2/20 21:59:08.966  Iâlluen-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sisters. Fair night.
2/20 21:59:13.809  Telariel-ArgentDawn places her empty cup down on the counter.
2/20 21:59:16.605  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Safe travels and may our troubles be diminished.
2/20 21:59:27.905  Telariel-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May Mother Moon watch over you, Sisters.
2/20 21:59:29.965  Arlièn-ArgentDawn bows her head in farewell to Iâlluen and Telariel.
2/20 22:00:39.517  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower scowls"
2/20 22:01:08.022  Yier has gone offline.
2/20 22:01:30.652  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Fools. We bring our loved ones back and they seek to stop us?"
2/20 22:02:12.224  Loralyn-ArgentDawn finishes her drink, heading back upstairs to her room.
2/20 22:02:40.557  Yier has come online.
2/20 22:03:44.603  Uodrieth has come online.
2/20 22:04:14.676  Arandell-ArgentDawn places a red envelope on the counter in front of Arlien with her name written on it.
2/20 22:04:15.976  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower growls: "Then we are meant to undo it. The price is worth paying"
2/20 22:04:28.606  You receive item: Red Ribboned Gift
2/20 22:05:02.418  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You scared them all away?
2/20 22:05:26.592  Arlièn-ArgentDawn sets her cup of tea away, and reaches out to the enveloppe, picking it up with both hands to study it.
2/20 22:05:27.511  Dalathria has come online.
2/20 22:05:36.964  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So it would seem.
2/20 22:06:31.589  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles briefly and looks around. The envelope clearly has some round and longish item inside it.
2/20 22:06:55.287  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] With my intimidating silence. Telariel and Ialluen went back to the outpost, and Loralyn went upstairs.
2/20 22:07:32.208  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: The spell will require power, and the bronze will need to be held at bay.
2/20 22:07:52.562  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, suppose could enjoy very silent town for a change. Nothing that can be done on the lists either.
2/20 22:08:55.025  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums in agreement but is more focussed on the enveloppe. After she spent sufficient time looking over the enveloppe, she opens it curious about what is inside.
2/20 22:09:44.174  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Quite rare even.
2/20 22:09:47.708  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Maybe. It doesn't have to be so. We do not want them to die. They just need to let us do what must be done."
2/20 22:09:52.698  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles.
2/20 22:10:22.381  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I could practice the harp! We could go fishing.
2/20 22:10:45.644  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: It's time
2/20 22:10:48.761  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles as she takes out the bottle, looking it over.
2/20 22:11:06.462  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: And if I understood correctly, it is in a smallish vial. Aaaand too slow. :P
2/20 22:11:12.840  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower shakes his head to Irrissia: "No, they do not."
2/20 22:11:20.905  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: no it isn't i've been waiting for blanchy for like an hour
2/20 22:11:35.510  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: finally gotten a korean girlfriend?
2/20 22:11:43.306  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: I never did that
2/20 22:11:49.020  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: and that's my reply to both of you :(
2/20 22:12:15.435  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mhm. Although think we should go to the east for patrol once more later.
2/20 22:12:42.655  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: whut?
2/20 22:12:55.032  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Duty, still. Even with a quiet town.
2/20 22:13:20.269  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: I think Tessa was putting the moonglow into smallish vials for the envelope thing, but I was too late in saying it.
2/20 22:13:29.807  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: aah
2/20 22:13:53.453  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, but you can still enjoy the peace and quiet for a little while... and a small drink.
2/20 22:13:58.018  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Do you want to help?" *Winterflower says softly*
2/20 22:14:42.494  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Undo all the death that has been caused, make sure our people are whole again?"
2/20 22:15:41.919  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and smiles, she looks around for a moment: "We both can."
2/20 22:16:35.677  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "I am certain things were taken from the research site. Sent it to Everlook, to the Snowplow with my name. They will see it delivered to the right people."
2/20 22:16:53.919  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods and smiles at that.
2/20 22:17:15.794  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "The work is what is most important. He needs those notes, the equipment is only secondary."
2/20 22:17:16.497  Iâlluen has gone offline.
2/20 22:17:53.242  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Does feel almost odd.
2/20 22:19:00.105  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Almost like a year ago.
2/20 22:19:09.540  Arlièn-ArgentDawn asks Nantar for two glasses.
2/20 22:19:48.331  Arandell-ArgentDawn shakes his head slightly. "No, no."
2/20 22:19:50.964  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: They might. Better act swiftly then, the snowplow are only mercenaries. They deliver some muscle.
2/20 22:19:56.132  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is for you.
2/20 22:20:35.567  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And yes, almost like that. Sometimes miss that.

2/20 22:22:01.145  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums amused to Arandell: "What would you like to drink then?'
2/20 22:22:57.938  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: Winterflower frowns: "That is a good point. He needs that information though."
2/20 22:23:16.816  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No. I do like the current situation too. It is good. Not always for us, but for Ashenvale. And in the end it is the greater good, hmm?
2/20 22:23:34.357  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "Return it to where you found. Dliever another spark of that lightning of yours. It should grab the attention of the others still there."
2/20 22:23:37.214  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will settle with tea tonight.
2/20 22:24:25.798  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: That draenei looks very decent for only lvl 15

2/20 22:26:24.175  Arlièn-ArgentDawn chuckles and smiles fondly to Arandell.
2/20 22:26:41.420  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Or shall I wait until after the patroll? Get our duty out of the way.
2/20 22:26:50.797  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Hi all

2/20 22:29:19.572  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums amusedly  to Arandell.
2/20 22:29:37.637  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods and chuckles.
2/20 22:29:53.038  Lirenna has come online.
2/20 22:30:05.904  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, we blame Tessa, if you drop on the floor.
2/20 22:30:07.437  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: How are you all?
2/20 22:30:18.045  Lirenna has gone offline.

2/20 22:31:41.119  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Hehest ?)
2/20 22:31:56.629  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and poors herself a glass with the alcohol. She looks from Arandell to Nantar: "More tea?"
2/20 22:32:05.910  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: (behest*)
2/20 22:32:20.444  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances towards Nantar and nods. "Why not."
2/20 22:32:41.240  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: You know what the best feeling is....fresh new socks after you got out of a rainstorm
2/20 22:32:58.468  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Also..screw all these damn storms! Enough already!

2/20 22:33:35.813  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "They likely know already. Don't mind me, the work must continue."

2/20 22:34:40.504  Frolbar has gone offline.
2/20 22:35:18.941  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Nantar as his used cup is refilled on the counter and passed to him.
2/20 22:35:30.511  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: "You seem to be a clever girl. You can figure it out."
2/20 22:36:09.724  Arandell-ArgentDawn picks up the cup and raises it, little bit lacking for a toast.
2/20 22:36:30.928  Arlièn-ArgentDawn raises her glass to Arandell: "To Ashenvale, to us."
2/20 22:38:17.622  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods and raises his cup bit more. "To Ashenvale, to us." He sips from the cup afterwards.
2/20 22:38:29.055  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Yeah just got back from work....had to go trough insane wind on the bike home pfew
2/20 22:38:29.923  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Delnaram-ArgentDawn: *The sound at the door anounces a Sentinel, who peaks around the door to check if everything is still going alright."
2/20 22:39:10.252  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Well and had dinner, got home a hour ago and ordered pizza, screw cooking when you don't have any breath left anymore from going home on the bike with the wind in your face smashing at you with 70+ kilometers per hour!
2/20 22:39:31.769  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: damn I'm sorry to hear Vash, At least you can rest now
2/20 22:39:32.842  Arlièn-ArgentDawn drinks from her glass, standing a little closer to Arandell.
2/20 22:39:58.215  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien silently for a moment before he speaks.
2/20 22:40:34.393  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Everything still alright here? Do not let him weasel his way out of them."
2/20 22:40:37.457  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Suppose I should start complaining lack of anyone to send out for tasks more often. Seems it almost complitelly empties the town.
2/20 22:41:08.337  [4. LookingForGroup] Induuros-ArgentDawn: :o
2/20 22:41:44.623  Arlièn-ArgentDawn chuckles and drinks a little more from her glass, savouring the taste.
2/20 22:41:57.227  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: That's life in the Netherlands
2/20 22:41:58.412  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So it seems. Means we still have to do more work though.
2/20 22:42:11.322  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Die hard bikers, crappy weather or not!

2/20 22:42:36.272  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The Dutch are born in the saddle.
2/20 22:42:36.313  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/20 22:42:58.732  [4. LookingForGroup] Induuros-ArgentDawn: 나는 당신을 오랫동안 사랑합니다
2/20 22:43:01.629  Arandell-ArgentDawn shifts the cup from his right hand to his left and is about to reach towards Arlien with the freed hand before he looks towards Vashira and stops. He inclines his head towards Vashira.

2/20 22:47:13.752  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay quickly head to Astranaar, without asking too much about the sentinels. The less know the truth, the better it will work.*

2/20 22:47:45.079  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Ah
2/20 22:47:57.245  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: well I never had one so no
2/20 22:48:04.915  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We can hope yes.
2/20 22:48:07.026  Vashíra-ArgentDawn nods a little
2/20 22:48:14.316  Káthene has come online.
2/20 22:48:23.781  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Anyway, I see the brother was about to make a move, so let me not hold you from a moment of yourselfs.
2/20 22:48:25.314  Vashíra-ArgentDawn smirks
2/20 22:48:42.603  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly and glances around before he again reaches towards Arlien, this time putting his arm around her and slightly moving closer to her.
2/20 22:48:49.161  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums: "It is rather quiet tonight."
2/20 22:49:29.951  Káthene has gone offline.
2/20 22:49:56.124  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Suprisingly so.
2/20 22:50:23.954  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing happened tonight? 
2/20 22:50:30.471  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Wait, where is the rest anyway?
2/20 22:50:32.700  Vashíra-ArgentDawn looks around
2/20 22:50:55.007  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ialluen got a pebble in mail. That is the most remarkable thing.
2/20 22:51:04.140  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The Sentinels are back at the outpost, ours  likely at the Hermitage.
2/20 22:51:16.281  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A pebble?
2/20 22:51:22.992  Vashíra-ArgentDawn raises her brow
2/20 22:52:33.105  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Small stone. And yes, almost none in town.
2/20 22:53:26.196  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I know what a pebble is.
2/20 22:53:26.790  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Draganigo-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/20 22:53:35.307  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good, good.
2/20 22:53:47.176  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: But that is not important right now
2/20 22:53:47.946  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm just surprissed she gets a pebble. Like..what is that suppose to mean? 
2/20 22:53:50.600  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly and looks at his cup while sipping from it.
2/20 22:53:51.321  Irrissia-ArgentDawn observes the trio in silence, one hand placed on the door frame.
2/20 22:54:10.415  Vashíra-ArgentDawn looks past Arlien at Tessa "Good fortune Tessa, do come close"
2/20 22:54:33.288  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You're OOC vash, btw
2/20 22:54:46.167  Arandell-ArgentDawn is holding a cup of tea in his left hand and having his right arm around Arlien. He glances over his shoulder and dips his head towards Tessa.
2/20 22:54:46.932  Irrissia-ArgentDawn seems reluctant to move.
2/20 22:55:09.792  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Evening, Tessa.
2/20 22:55:43.225  Arlièn-ArgentDawn looks over her shoulder at Tessaemay, giving her a brief smile: "Are you quite alright?"
2/20 22:56:10.525  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Quick brb
2/20 22:56:24.381  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Thanks!
2/20 22:56:28.677  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales slowly and nods. "'Evening. Yes. Can... we. Speak ?"
2/20 22:56:35.009  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: These two are useless..not once mentioned it!
2/20 22:56:43.041  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: xD
2/20 22:56:58.400  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So much for peace and quiet.
2/20 22:57:24.497  Arandell-ArgentDawn chuckles briefly and withdraws his right arm stepping bit further from Arlien.
2/20 22:57:36.970  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters. "All... three."

2/20 22:58:14.930  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shows her scary cat behaviour, at the moment. It would need only a loud noise to get her to dash away.
2/20 22:58:27.372  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, we all three are here and more or less nobody else is... What is wrong?
2/20 22:59:02.411  Vashíra-ArgentDawn gives a gentle smile "Or we can go elsewhere if you prefer"
2/20 22:59:09.110  Irrissia-ArgentDawn clenches her teeth, glancing above her shoulders, a glimmer of paranoia passing in her gaze.
2/20 22:59:23.383  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: back
2/20 22:59:30.551  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You okay?
2/20 22:59:31.516  Vashíra peers at Irrissia searchingly.
2/20 23:00:44.140  Arlièn-ArgentDawn looks to her glass. It is almost empty and with a little sigh, she downs the last of its contents before she sets it back on the counter. She looks to Tessaemay more carefully.
2/20 23:01:03.127  Irrissia-ArgentDawn tenses up as Vashira approaches, but she nods nevertheless.

2/20 23:01:56.882  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: USELESS!
2/20 23:03:12.289  Arandell-ArgentDawn takes the cup from his left hand with his right and sips from it.
2/20 23:03:17.612  Irrissia-ArgentDawn moves slightly one step further, slidding a little near the wall, not at ease being focused by the trio. Especially when Arlien moved.
2/20 23:03:42.251  Vashíra-ArgentDawn raises her brow as she studies Tessa, but let's Arlien do the word.
2/20 23:03:43.698  Arlièn-ArgentDawn starts to hum her soothing song, almost out of habbit.
2/20 23:04:45.398  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head slightly.
2/20 23:05:04.582  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her ears when Arlien starts to sing, it doesn't seem to really change something.
2/20 23:05:14.568  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Will you tell us what happened?
2/20 23:05:34.420  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "B-but not... here."
2/20 23:05:37.486  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Alright. Vash, you throw a dagger at ger feet and tackle her, I will hold her hands, if she runs.
2/20 23:05:45.719  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: xDDD WHAT

2/20 23:06:07.926  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let us head on over to the pier then.
2/20 23:06:14.517  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly.
2/20 23:06:23.548  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: So you let me do all the work again huh? Pfff
2/20 23:06:34.367  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Closer and faster.
2/20 23:06:38.245  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: All that violence, when a hug would have the same effect
2/20 23:06:48.673  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: But we are good at the violence.
2/20 23:06:49.357  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: But less fun
2/20 23:06:59.383  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: It is much more stressing to hug.
2/20 23:07:03.445  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I'm reconsidering which side I'm on, during that campaign.
2/20 23:07:19.430  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks around again, rubbing her arm slowly.
2/20 23:07:57.822  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: You know, if we are doing that to our friends... Imagine what we do, if you side with druids.
2/20 23:08:03.354  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: The enemy. Not druids.
2/20 23:08:25.154  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales deeply. "I spoke with Winterflower."
2/20 23:08:36.855  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Is there a difference?
2/20 23:08:50.444  Arandell-ArgentDawn slowly sips from his cup and tilts his head.
2/20 23:08:54.514  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Fair point.
2/20 23:09:31.802  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah, that explains. What...What did he say?
2/20 23:11:04.925  Irrissia-ArgentDawn eventually sits, hugging her knees tightly. "Sounded like... his 'friends' could likely watch us... I just... don't know how far around Auberdine they might be."
2/20 23:11:33.140  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] An expected course of action.

2/20 23:13:14.309  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums  and sits down beside Tessaemay, giving her an encouraging smile.
2/20 23:13:19.567  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 23:13:54.498  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Wouldn't you want people watching those who just attacked your people as soon as possible?
2/20 23:14:48.730  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arlien, distressed. "Do... you think it could be true, Arlien ? Change the course of time... to avoid that ?"
2/20 23:15:35.175  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It must be true
2/20 23:16:20.419  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is not my area of expertise. But I know the Bronze always are on the lookout for such events, to make sure things run their course. How painfull they may be.
2/20 23:16:52.284  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Stories on such things tend to end quite badly.
2/20 23:17:19.733  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her gaze, a glimmer of doubt passing in her gaze.
2/20 23:19:23.218  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at his prosthetic arm for a moment thoughtfully before looking back towards Tessa.
2/20 23:20:24.649  Vashíra-ArgentDawn doesn't really know what to say.
2/20 23:21:04.793  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: What if... it could be done ? Wouldn't... we the ones in the wrong ? *She rests her head on her knees* To... prevent it ?
2/20 23:22:19.367  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No.
2/20 23:22:25.738  Arandell-ArgentDawn frowns and quickly shakes his head.
2/20 23:22:37.497  Irrissia-ArgentDawn slowly glances at Vashira, and then Arandell.
2/20 23:22:39.731  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] First what he said. We can argue morality of it later.
2/20 23:24:04.677  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To mess with time simply is not okay. Things happened, they make us who we are. We learn from them, we get stronger cause of them, we are better prepared cause of them. If we keep altering time cause something bad happened, we will never learn, never »
2/20 23:24:04.677  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her gaze on the pier, remaining silent after Arandell almost order.

2/20 23:25:03.899  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Huh... Very good words, if most lived.
2/20 23:25:27.901  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Applauds Vashíra. Tis difficult to go preaching on my own introduced problem
2/20 23:25:38.637  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Uhuh
2/20 23:26:03.591  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I just tossed some morality in the middle, because I refuse to make it too easy on them :p I may just be a player, but I'm biased.
2/20 23:26:17.247  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: xD
2/20 23:26:17.777  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: So all... those who died...?
2/20 23:26:32.922  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Takes her TEAM GM flad out.*
2/20 23:26:36.690  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well, it does really seem like a good thing to do. 
2/20 23:27:48.452  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Then where do we draw the line Tessa? Yes, many of our kin died, that is very sad, and we honour them by keeping them in our memory. But what if we keep altering time cause someone we cared about got killed? What concequences will that have for the »
2/20 23:27:49.233  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » future? When did we mess with time enough? We will always lose someone we cared about, due to war, illness or a unfortunate accident. Are we to travel into time to save each and everyone of them time and time again?

2/20 23:30:25.842  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The idea sounds nice, bring back all that we lost, prevent it ever happened. And we all want out kin back, but there is a reason why the Bronze is guarding the timeline.
2/20 23:30:33.872  Arandell-ArgentDawn drinks what remains in his cup and leans to set it down on the pier next to him.
2/20 23:30:53.939  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] As if dragons did not make mistakes.
2/20 23:31:18.974  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Offcourse they have, but aren't we still blaming humans of making mistakes we made thousands of years ago as well?
2/20 23:32:25.650  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales slowly and mutters. "They want to use the energy from a bronze dragon to cast their spell..."
2/20 23:32:39.903  Arandell-ArgentDawn scoffs quietly before looking at Tessa.
2/20 23:32:53.005  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Just because they made a mistake, doesn't mean their reasoning isn't right.

2/20 23:33:59.151  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 23:35:52.006  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks up at Arandell, tensed. She slowly gestures her hands as she explains :
2/20 23:36:44.275  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I made him believe I came to give him food, without planning to stay any longer. He started by mocking our choice to send a youngling, and then... He angered when I said he had no right to do what he plans to do.
2/20 23:37:27.394  Arandell-ArgentDawn smiles a little at Tessa while listening.
2/20 23:37:31.382  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I pretended to leave, but asked him just before if he was sure he could really do it.
2/20 23:38:38.053  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: That's... where I learned a first thing. The materials isn't the most important. But their notes... We should... burn them. I could read them all, and we burn them. Because if they manage to recover them, that's what they need the most to pursue.
2/20 23:39:45.963  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: After; he explained me how they need to restrain a bronze dragon and use it to feed their spell. They... shouldn't die from it, but... But they aren't sure.
2/20 23:40:40.573  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And then... He explained me how to get... his... friends attention.
2/20 23:41:09.273  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: We could... send everything to the Snowplow, and they would be able to reach those friends, but they are just mercenaries. They don't know much. However...
2/20 23:41:59.107  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: If we return to Auberdine... With another lightning, I could grab the attention of those still lingering here.
2/20 23:43:15.400  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Those people are call... Willowsheart, if I understood well. It's an order. They have an observatory. But I don't know how. Asking would have be too suspicious.
2/20 23:43:33.098  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: It's time.
2/20 23:43:52.599  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And the person that should be around is called Summerbreeze.
2/20 23:44:00.498  [4. LookingForGroup] Anas-ArgentDawn: WHERE IS HE
2/20 23:44:16.567  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Banned... for antisemitism 
2/20 23:44:42.468  Arandell-ArgentDawn folds his arms nodding few times as he listens.
2/20 23:44:50.875  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales, likely done with her explanations. "Then, Sentinels arrived and told me to leave. I pretended to be here to see to his injuries, and he is convinced I'm on his side, now."
2/20 23:46:00.932  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So we could carry on with that lie. Some sympathetic to the cause.
2/20 23:46:18.559  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: S-so... I was thinking... to make copies of the books and calcul sheets, but with... wrong results. Slight differences for no one to be able to tell without inspecting them closely.
2/20 23:46:47.989  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And then try to... meet that Summerbreeze. Pretend I'm down to help them.
2/20 23:47:16.788  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That's not a bad idea.
2/20 23:47:54.337  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But to gain his trust, you have to deliver something of truth first.
2/20 23:48:04.900  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: The ideal would be to bring only a part of those researches. Explain I couldn't manage to get everything immediatly, and I needed to try to find the rest that you are hoarding.
2/20 23:48:38.591  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I took the ones remaining in the ruins. You can say you could not get to those ones.
2/20 23:49:02.894  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arandell Moonsong.
2/20 23:49:15.130  Yurion has come online.
2/20 23:49:27.395  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And from those I have, I could give them the sheets, but not the books to begin with. And those could be the true ones.
2/20 23:50:02.623  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Those sheets are mostly records of their past attempts. Not enough to real bring them closer to their goals, unlike the books.
2/20 23:51:04.848  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But do you think you can do it?
2/20 23:51:51.569  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: ...Even if I don't think so... Do we have the choice ?
2/20 23:51:52.114  Vashíra-ArgentDawn looks at Tessa as Arandell asks the question.
2/20 23:52:06.823  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She already got this far.
2/20 23:52:11.710  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Small correction: They seem to be part of their experiments, they are not trying to go at it all at once.
2/20 23:52:19.283  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And I doubt he will believe it if it was you or me.
2/20 23:52:35.750  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: What ? The sheets ?
2/20 23:52:44.683  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Likely not or at least be much more careful. But...
2/20 23:53:35.040  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is a tempting cause.
2/20 23:53:52.008  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: The sheets are calculations for the timejump, like Thalyndrae underwent. The books are the notes on the effects and the results of experiments they did there.
2/20 23:54:00.129  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: All to work towards the greater goal.
2/20 23:54:10.634  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head and looks at Tessa.
2/20 23:54:16.401  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Yeah okey. That's what I understood
2/20 23:54:26.468  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Cause you could not be swayed to aid in?
2/20 23:54:52.601  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A valid concern
2/20 23:55:25.201  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Cause if they can really alter time and prevent Teldrassil from happening, would you be strong enough to resist that urge to prevent it?
2/20 23:55:25.968  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I have no clue what you sentence mean, Aran

2/20 23:56:01.663  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: I think he meant it that the cause they are after is a very temping one, and if Tessa can with stand temptations to work with them to aid their cause.
2/20 23:56:03.763  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I would not even trust myself fully.
2/20 23:56:11.154  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Cool :-)
2/20 23:56:11.374  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I could have gone for the Darkshore straight away, without telling anyone.
2/20 23:56:28.622  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That still doesn't mean you can't be swayed later on Tessa.
2/20 23:56:38.640  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes. He is basicly asking, if Tessa belives she would not betray us to prevent Teldrassil from burning.
2/20 23:56:51.085  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks down a moment, pondering.
2/20 23:57:19.605  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You will have to listen a lot more... and you questioned it after first talk already. It concerns me.
2/20 23:57:27.133  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: time to hit the bed. Good night friends
2/20 23:57:39.660  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/20 23:57:40.160  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: G'night o/
2/20 23:57:41.209  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You could be in doubt right now, but what if it becomes a real thing. Were you have to chose, do you help them bring back our kin and mess with time, or do you interfene and have all of our kin remain lost while you know you could have brought htem back.
2/20 23:57:47.730  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Goodnight!
2/20 23:57:47.730  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Or rather sounded like you were concidering them being right.
2/20 23:58:19.691  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods at Vashira's words.
2/20 23:58:45.092  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And for the record, no one here would blame you either if it is to tempting. It is very tempting, hence Arandell said he doesn't even trust himself with it.
2/20 23:58:58.027  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I questionned it because... I needed to hear the truth, Arandell. Not a fake : "We shouldn't do it." Because a lots of things around us, in my life, even, were just... "You shouldn't do it." With no logical reason behind.
2/20 23:59:25.198  Makhalann has gone offline.
2/20 23:59:29.391  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Then let me ask you this.
2/20 23:59:44.724  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/21 00:00:00.591  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Will you be able to question the situations you find yourself in with logics, or with emotions?
2/21 00:00:55.837  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stares at Vashira, before slowly muttering. "I would know the truth."
2/21 00:01:38.552  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I... It doesn't matter what I would chose. The reality... is that I would know the truth. I would know that, even if I chose to help them, it wouldn't be true.
2/21 00:02:01.454  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And at the same time, you would know by not helping them, you prevented our kin to live.
2/21 00:02:10.087  Irrissia-ArgentDawn wipes her eyes quickly, chasing some tears away from her face. "And we all know I would never forhget it."
2/21 00:02:35.788  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It's not a life, Vashira. It would just be a lie.
2/21 00:02:47.454  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is it a lie when they stand before you?
2/21 00:03:05.022  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When they laugh, eat, drink, live their lives without knowing they were never suppose to be here anymore?
2/21 00:03:47.389  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: For me, it would be.
2/21 00:04:05.834  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But only for you.
2/21 00:04:21.035  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: But I'm the one who would have to choose.
2/21 00:05:04.290  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, if you think you are strong enough. But I would urge you to take the night to think about it long and hard.
2/21 00:05:29.524  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would it really be that bad to have that lie excist? Isn't it worth the sacrifice, you knowing it isn't all real, but for our Kin it is reallity, the families torn appart together again. Mothers holding their children again. Lovers united again. »
2/21 00:05:30.489  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » Brothers and sisters together once more.
2/21 00:06:07.489  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Stop convincing her that much! :P
2/21 00:06:17.491  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Me back in all my prettyness and not this disfigured burnmark on my face.
2/21 00:06:20.589  Vashíra-ArgentDawn smirks slightly.
2/21 00:06:39.823  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: There is reason behind why she asks it like that!
2/21 00:06:42.422  Irrissia-ArgentDawn ears drop on her shoulders as she remains silent, shaking slightly.
2/21 00:06:45.155  Arandell-ArgentDawn sighs quietly and glances at his left arm again.
2/21 00:06:59.566  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: I know what you are doing, but bloody hell... :P
2/21 00:07:14.134  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: You are convincing Aran soon on it. :P
2/21 00:07:36.025  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Keeper, would you?
2/21 00:08:14.494  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Great lookout you are Arlien..the only eyes down the docks and didn't warn us a assassin was behind us..gjees!
2/21 00:08:49.008  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/21 00:08:55.231  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: To be fair... She is old druid, did you expect the eyes be open?
2/21 00:09:35.638  Yurion has gone offline.
2/21 00:09:46.575  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It all sounds very tempting, but I would not want to suffer through it again..
2/21 00:10:27.375  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arandell?
2/21 00:10:42.532  Irrissia looks at Arandell.
2/21 00:12:02.934  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I... do not know. I will do as I am told, if only not to betray my loyalties...

2/21 00:14:28.248  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Tessa, if you feel any doubt, now or in the future. Go to the Keeper, tell her or come to me, tell me. I'm sorry brother, but you are a liability in this right now. We can't have any doubts in this. Temptations can become to much to bear. 
2/21 00:14:53.134  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Vashira.
2/21 00:15:02.859  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You are the only linke we have with them.
2/21 00:15:18.793  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I-I... know b-but...
2/21 00:15:46.429  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: No... Matter what you said, no matter what I... I would chose... It would never erase... Teldrassil from my memories.
2/21 00:16:56.082  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good, then you focus on that. But that is all fine and well, until it starts to get really well. Everyone reacts different from what they say they would do. It is a massive weight that will be put on your shoulders.
2/21 00:17:06.014  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Sorry Arandell xD
2/21 00:17:07.387  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: That's all. That's... where... the temptation end, for me. If I could revive everyone, without any coast... any consequences... I would do it, of course. But in that... specific case ? Kill someone else... a dragon. For... that ? For a fake... version »
2/21 00:17:08.175  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: » of the reality, that would likely weaken everyone ?
2/21 00:17:25.702  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Its fair. :)
2/21 00:17:58.856  Irrissia-ArgentDawn wipes her cheeks again, her nerves seemingly broken, not properly capable to remain collected.
2/21 00:18:03.726  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: It helps to been raised as a psycopath killer when it comes to such emotions xD
2/21 00:18:28.857  Vashíra-ArgentDawn nods slightly
2/21 00:18:59.853  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums softly and encouragingly to Tessaemay, putting an arm around the young girl.
2/21 00:19:12.044  Arandell-ArgentDawn sighs quietly.
2/21 00:20:21.278  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shivers at Arlien's contact, hiccuping softly escaping a small whine. She covers her eyes a minute.
2/21 00:21:42.805  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: brb
2/21 00:23:56.373  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That was very brave.
2/21 00:24:43.098  Irrissia-ArgentDawn sniffs softly,passing her sleeve on her face. She inhales, before looking at Arlien. "Would have... say stupid."
2/21 00:24:55.671  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: back
2/21 00:25:30.674  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances between everyone present before looking over his shoulder.
2/21 00:26:27.019  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But this was worth the outcome. And what you choose to do next is just as brave.
2/21 00:27:06.263  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: If they offered me to forget about it, Arlien... I would have say yes. I'm... not that brave.
2/21 00:27:40.002  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Raven... A word in private?
2/21 00:27:49.536  Vashíra-ArgentDawn nods
2/21 00:28:23.220  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at them as they leave. "And they... probably don't believe me brave enough neither..."
2/21 00:29:03.528  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They agreed to it.
2/21 00:29:18.459  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Because they have no other choice...
2/21 00:30:30.289  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And why is that?
2/21 00:30:50.270  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: They said it. I'm their only link with the... people we look for.
2/21 00:31:45.282  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Those people do not know that.
2/21 00:32:43.735  Irrissia-ArgentDawn rests her head on her knees, unconfident. "I'm not sure I can... do that. The pressure..."
2/21 00:32:44.668  Irrissia-ArgentDawn :s
2/21 00:33:31.236  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters, lowering her gaze. "I will... never feel good enough. For anything."
2/21 00:35:02.794  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm, that may be. But there is a difference between feeling and being able. Don't let doubt overrule you.
2/21 00:35:55.443  Irrissia-ArgentDawn rubs her right hand slowly. "You speak like Glaedr."
2/21 00:37:07.480  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles gently to Tessaemay: "I take that as a compliment"
2/21 00:38:12.864  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Not... really. He told me that before I made my vow to Mandala'dor. Before... I got freed from the curse placed on me by that Satyr.
2/21 00:38:32.763  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Okay, I changed my mind..let's alter the time line...we can't have Vash being this responsible! 
2/21 00:38:37.063  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I was angry and... in pain. I told him I wanted to give up... And that the Satyr had won. I couldn't do it.
2/21 00:38:53.349  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: XD PLEASE. TESSA IS DOUBTING TOO. We can't afford that in the same time !
2/21 00:39:39.732  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Oh don't give away the reason for the word in private. :P
2/21 00:39:53.362  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "Why then a negative?"
2/21 00:40:10.212  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Don't worry, your secrect about you having trouble to perform your manly duties to the keeper are safe with me!
2/21 00:40:19.990  Rethion-ArgentDawn comes flying down with his large silver crescent form. Gust of winds blowing from his large wings as he settles down on to his talons and hoots toward the two kaldorei women. 
2/21 00:40:43.876  Irrissia-ArgentDawn was about to open her mouth to answer but freeze, feeling the wind moving due to the massive owl landing.
2/21 00:40:47.527  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: I changed my mind. Going to backstab you lot so hard... :P
2/21 00:40:59.217  Arlièn-ArgentDawn blinks as she looks to Rethion: "Rethion?"
2/21 00:41:16.530  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There are some books, and this old geezer in the prison
2/21 00:41:30.859  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Preferably with a word and not with a dagger.
2/21 00:41:38.384  Rethion-ArgentDawn spreads his wings as the winds of emerald would circle his being and start to alter his form. "Ishnu'alah, sister." 
2/21 00:41:50.145  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Selection box on him is huge as bird
2/21 00:42:01.706  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune, Brother.
2/21 00:42:03.224  Rethion bows before Vashíra.
2/21 00:42:08.227  Arlièn-ArgentDawn smiles and inclines her head to Rethion.
2/21 00:42:09.397  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Rethion.
2/21 00:42:19.496  Vashíra-ArgentDawn inclines her head at Rethion.
2/21 00:42:22.963  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Bird... looks more like a goofy dinosaur.
2/21 00:42:30.842  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Apologies for dropping in. Am I disturbing in anything?
2/21 00:43:19.106  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, we were in the middle of something, sadly.
2/21 00:43:27.778  Irrissia-ArgentDawn slowly inclinces her head for the druid.
2/21 00:43:31.688  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Understood. 
2/21 00:43:43.890  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'll leave you to talk. 
2/21 00:43:44.113  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I do enjoy seeing you again. I pray you do not have trouble of your own?
2/21 00:43:49.201  Rethion smiles at you.
2/21 00:44:00.988  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Quite the opposite. I've been very fortunate of late.
2/21 00:44:12.958  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I would love to hear of that, later on.
2/21 00:44:22.178  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] By all means. 
2/21 00:44:47.232  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Rethion once more.
2/21 00:44:54.167  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: Bit better these days?
2/21 00:45:05.549  Rethion-ArgentDawn shifts his golden gaze toward Vashira for a moment, feeling the stare. He raises his wooden hand and waves at her a little.
2/21 00:45:20.549  Vashíra-ArgentDawn inclines her head.
2/21 00:45:34.284  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: Yes and no? Its been rough. But I am getting a surgery to help.
2/21 00:45:37.315  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune brohter
2/21 00:45:40.239  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *brother
2/21 00:45:51.584  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And to you, sister. Shall we gave them some space?
2/21 00:46:03.911  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I'm part of it.
2/21 00:46:06.166  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ah, they were part of the conversation.
2/21 00:46:12.879  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My apologies yet again! 
2/21 00:46:21.593  Rethion-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Right! Excuse me then.
2/21 00:46:23.276  Rethion bows down graciously.
2/21 00:46:24.774  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Rethion Moonshred, politely.
2/21 00:46:25.986  Vashíra bows before Rethion.
2/21 00:46:31.147  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head.
2/21 00:46:34.750  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: Come dropping in at exactly the wrong moment.
2/21 00:46:41.901  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: xD May I ask what is going on?
2/21 00:46:57.913  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her eyes, falling silent, starting to idly play with her ribbon.
2/21 00:47:20.146  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: Little event that I have concucted, they are currently discussing infiltrating an enemy base
2/21 00:47:32.250  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: what kind of enemy?
2/21 00:47:56.955  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: Debatable? It is a group that is trying to rewind time on Teldrassil
2/21 00:48:12.418  Arandell-ArgentDawn folds his arms and takes a deep breath.
2/21 00:48:32.487  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: kaldorei?
2/21 00:48:38.789  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: ya
2/21 00:48:40.498  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: Oh dear. Kaldorei fighting other kaldorei...
2/21 00:48:42.792  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: grim...
2/21 00:48:44.355  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: so grim
2/21 00:49:16.290  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: so wait, does Arlien know everyone involved in this or could she suspect Rethion to be involved as one of these "enemies"?
2/21 00:49:53.708  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: They'll likely bring you up to speed later on, but Tessaemay is fragile and they were discussing a delicate point
2/21 00:50:13.978  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I really hope someone is speaking
2/21 00:50:21.477  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Like. Actually typing something
2/21 00:50:35.946  Rethion-ArgentDawn whispers: Poor thing. And in comes a big ol' oak just crashing right into the conversation.
2/21 00:50:43.199  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: *looks around whisteling* Hmm, what?
2/21 00:50:48.707  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: yup
2/21 00:51:21.279  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: I was waiting cause you two seemed to be talking xD
2/21 00:51:43.741  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Was Glaedr in the wrong back then?
2/21 00:52:03.817  To Rethion-ArgentDawn: So not necesarily because of the event, or you, just the moment that it took place
2/21 00:52:54.805  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arlien and shrugs her right shoulder, softly mumbling. "That's... what broke me. Slowly. The... burning sensation in the arms and the... constant feeling of being watched. It never really left me once the curse was lifted."
2/21 00:57:00.622  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "I hear you. It takes time to shed that."
2/21 00:57:44.203  Arandell-ArgentDawn tilts his head slightly.
2/21 00:58:09.737  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] How long time it was?
2/21 00:58:27.203  No player named 'Delnaram' is currently playing.
2/21 00:58:27.203  No player named 'Delnaram' is currently playing.
2/21 00:58:37.504  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: ...You were there for that fight, Arandell. The... satyr.
2/21 00:59:41.870  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Seven month and nineteen nights ago. If you want the exact... numbers.
2/21 00:59:42.704  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That. But how long you were cursed before?
2/21 01:00:24.670  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You may have told that in the begining, but I do not have your memory.
2/21 01:01:23.537  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] He does get old Tessa *smirks*
2/21 01:01:41.071  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And I was cursed for six months and twenty four nights.
2/21 01:01:45.270  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I HAVE  TO DO MATHS
2/21 01:01:49.104  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: BECAUSE OF YOU
2/21 01:01:59.604  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I HATE THAT IDEA OF FLAWLESS MEMORY WHY DID I DO THAT ????
2/21 01:02:10.970  Arandell-ArgentDawn glances at Vashira. "Oi..." before he nods at Tessa again.
2/21 01:02:23.870  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Long time to feel that.
2/21 01:02:34.105  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (That's what's in my head everytime Tessa tell you exactly how long passed between two events.)
2/21 01:02:43.264  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Muahahahaha!
2/21 01:02:55.064  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Can't wait to be forced to add 800~ years to that soon)
2/21 01:03:03.463  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: You know how often I am tempted to get exact numbers from her about random things that have been talked about?
2/21 01:03:11.263  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Often
2/21 01:03:14.896  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ANd don't do it.
2/21 01:03:31.429  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: xD
2/21 01:03:35.562  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Hmm... Now for every boop you make...
2/21 01:03:36.162  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods, not really understanding where he is going.
2/21 01:03:52.369  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I can bullshit numbers, you realise that ?
2/21 01:03:57.306  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: hehe xD
2/21 01:04:10.327  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: When did that sunday trap trigger?
2/21 01:04:47.530  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Also that was it. He is not going anywhere else with it.
2/21 01:04:49.660  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Also, if you want to do the whole infiltration gig, I may need to postpone a few events
2/21 01:05:39.249  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Does it means we would get less time in timeloss ?
2/21 01:05:54.940  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Because we haven't finished the planning -yet- so... I rather know now xD
2/21 01:05:57.718  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: No, just that the whole event is pushed back to an extend
2/21 01:06:01.036  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Yes ?
2/21 01:06:16.867  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm?
2/21 01:06:18.869  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Oh. That's fine.
2/21 01:06:28.501  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I'm not sure to understand where you're going with that...
2/21 01:06:56.700  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Time for my chores.
2/21 01:07:02.167  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Goddess watch over you all.
2/21 01:07:04.834  Vashíra bows down graciously.
2/21 01:07:07.277  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Curiosity. Understanding how long the torment was.
2/21 01:07:17.570  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Vashira.
2/21 01:07:22.688  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Vashíra.
2/21 01:07:28.127  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Goodnight all!
2/21 01:07:29.626  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] May Her light guide us.
2/21 01:07:30.801  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good hunting, Vashira.
2/21 01:07:31.847  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: GOodnight!
2/21 01:07:35.352  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: G'night o/
2/21 01:07:40.972  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: G'night!
2/21 01:08:15.780  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Nn !
2/21 01:08:24.015  Vashíra has gone offline.
2/21 01:08:35.747  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I guess... not a lot for our lifespawn.
2/21 01:08:53.747  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Time hit differently when you don't forget.
2/21 01:09:29.080  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not the way I would look at it.
2/21 01:09:42.180  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Which way would it be ?
2/21 01:10:44.300  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It may not be long time compared to living few millennias, but it is very long time to constantly feel... unsafe?
2/21 01:11:24.484  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You... realise I feel unsafe since I am... seventeen ?
2/21 01:12:09.483  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Perhaps I chose a wrong word for it.
2/21 01:12:12.050  Irrissia-ArgentDawn looks away, bitting her upper lip, as if she said something she wasn't mean to share.
2/21 01:12:48.916  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers faintly. "I think... it was... the perfect word, actually."
2/21 01:13:39.771  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... Then for the sake of it, let us say, more so than usually at the very least.
2/21 01:13:52.913  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and gives Tessaemay a comforting  squeeze.
2/21 01:15:00.207  Irrissia-ArgentDawn rubs her hands slowly, in silence, before finally saying, lowly. "Lots of pressure... It was... not very far from what I was... used to."
2/21 01:15:35.507  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods and sighs quietly.
2/21 01:15:56.809  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sad little thing.
2/21 01:16:41.209  Irrissia-ArgentDawn escapes a long sigh. "Teldrassil was the only place I ever felt safe for a long period of time. I... I never felt it. No... pressure, no... crushing expectation I couldn't met, no... constant remembers to not be enough, no fear of getting suddenly »
2/21 01:16:41.475  Irrissia-ArgentDawn » assaulted by wardens o-or... by... other highbornes... Just a normal life."
2/21 01:17:22.795  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I should be going to bed :-(
2/21 01:17:32.817  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Well. Go ? xD
2/21 01:17:50.650  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Hehe.
2/21 01:18:41.950  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let us then hope, there will be another place of such in time.
2/21 01:19:09.979  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head at Arandell Moonsong.
2/21 01:19:40.426  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I made peace with that, you know. I... I can say I'm a bit sad, sometime. Normal life was... good. Could have lived like that forever.
2/21 01:20:42.067  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: But... Everything. All that happened in my life... it brough me to Mandala'dor, at one point. And no matter how hard it was, how... pressured I felt... I knew I was doing the right things. And... I think that's also why I'm in the Hermitage now. To do »
2/21 01:20:42.544  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: » the righ things. For... other young brothers and sisters. For them to have what I didn't enjoyed.
2/21 01:21:11.111  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods slowly.
2/21 01:21:52.937  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To do the right thing to. To do what must be done so someone else does not need to.
2/21 01:22:09.241  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums as in a prayer: "For those that might remember us."
2/21 01:23:24.804  Arlièn-ArgentDawn gives Tessaemay a smile and another squeeze, before she gets up to her feet and dusts off her robe.
2/21 01:23:47.481  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods firmly. "It must have a meaning. That... pain and that saddeness. Those losses... It's too late for a normal life, now. A-and... no matter how... crazy I may look sometime, I just... keep holding on that. The idea that it's why I'm walking that »
2/21 01:23:47.714  Irrissia-ArgentDawn » path. To... Allow other to have a normal life."
2/21 01:24:36.122  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stands up as Arlien does, sweeping her dress softly, looking suddenly more herself than she ever did since she got injuried by that cube, months ago.
2/21 01:24:57.919  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Mmm... I suppose, such things are never ment to be easy. At least something worth staying alive for.

2/21 01:25:41.149  Arandell-ArgentDawn smirks briefly.
2/21 01:25:47.150  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales deeply. "I... I would like to avoid that. Just for some times. To have a chance to heal."
2/21 01:26:36.130  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.
2/21 01:26:40.861  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sooner or later.
2/21 01:26:46.061  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks at Arlien.
2/21 01:26:54.975  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Time to prepair for another patrol?
2/21 01:27:44.305  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, it is. We'll take the south again, just in case. Let Vashira handle the border with Darkshore.
2/21 01:28:01.638  |Kq5|k whispers: A quick question before you vanish.
2/21 01:28:21.531  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Time to chase shadows and wind again. Hopefully.
2/21 01:28:48.077  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods: "With luck.
2/21 01:29:04.400  |Kq5|k whispers: I was expecting to do the "infiltration thing" out of events, but do you want to actually do it while eventing ? I mean, we still need to discuss IC about it, but if we trully walk to the infiltration thing, I don't really see myself ask "Hey, let's »
2/21 01:29:04.857  |Kq5|k whispers: » all have an event, when I will do something and you're gonna wait in bushes."
2/21 01:29:09.605  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We will speak with you again later, Tessaemay. May our troubles be diminished.
2/21 01:29:21.117  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I will go back to the Hermitage, to start to copy the notes...
2/21 01:29:35.577  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We will stop there first too.
2/21 01:29:43.554  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We can walk together.
2/21 01:29:47.245  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arandell Moonsong.
2/21 01:29:54.093  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/21 01:29:55.507  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Would be nice, yes.
2/21 01:29:59.337  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Or Aran will at least. :P
2/21 01:30:41.620  To |Kq5|k: Infiltration takes time, unless you want to go only once and then raport back
2/21 01:30:58.538  |Kq5|k whispers: I was more thinking of that.
2/21 01:31:04.757  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Time to poof
2/21 01:31:09.389  |Kq5|k whispers: Going once, find the location, come back, reports, and let the other do nice stuffs ?
2/21 01:31:17.726  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yup.
2/21 01:31:26.813  |Kq5|k whispers: (Not because I don't want to, but more because it's not -super- fun as it's a solo work.)

2/21 01:34:30.660  To |Kq5|k: Check, we can work with that. I will be out for sports tomorrow, so will be a tad tight again

2/21 12:35:34.989  Thrall says: It is no use, the power of the Dragon Soul is too great. I cannot wield it safely; the raging forces contained within it may be the doom of us all.

2/21 12:38:25.742  Thrall says: Heroes, this burden falls to you once again.
2/21 12:38:31.842  Thrall says: You must protect us from Deathwing's forces while we imbue the Dragon Soul with the power of the Aspects.
2/21 12:38:41.442  Thrall says: Speak to me when you are ready to begin.

2/21 22:57:21.903  Irrissia-ArgentDawn grabs Ellemayne and hands her to Selrian. "Take care of her."

2/21 22:57:49.769  Irrissia-ArgentDawn gives her a final scratch, and follows.
2/21 22:57:54.603  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good luck.

2/21 22:57:57.905  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arandell Moonsong.
2/21 22:58:00.635  Vashíra nods at Arandell.
2/21 22:58:04.968  Servantis lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
2/21 22:58:58.256  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Vashira.

2/21 22:59:10.950  Irrissia-ArgentDawn tilts her head, looking at Vashira Ravenheart.
2/21 22:59:33.820  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Just double checking
2/21 22:59:46.101  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Made me chuckle OOC.
2/21 23:00:00.087  Irrissia looks at Vashíra.
2/21 23:00:18.943  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No, why would i?
2/21 23:00:29.525  Vashíra-ArgentDawn looks over her shoulder
2/21 23:00:33.811  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I don't know. Just... you looked nervous ?
2/21 23:00:48.585  Vashíra-ArgentDawn raises her brow "What gave you that impression?"
2/21 23:00:59.877  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Double checking is standard procedure on such missions.
2/21 23:01:13.196  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I'm not used to that...
2/21 23:01:25.781  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Probably because I'm not really the one doing that kind of things, usually...
2/21 23:02:06.440  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I know... I'm just... nervous myself.
2/21 23:02:55.223  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Understandable, it's not a easy task. You will do fine, you already gained his trust a bit
2/21 23:03:21.908  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: He is convinced I'm on his side...
2/21 23:03:40.147  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: But I feel like he was easier to fool than those I will meet.
2/21 23:05:21.192  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I know. I'm using it.
2/21 23:05:30.229  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: A lie is more realist, builded upon some truth.
2/21 23:05:56.019  Orux Thrice-Damned yells: There is no blood easier spilt than that of a puny night elf!
2/21 23:06:19.710  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I used my distress about Teldrassil to pretend I was vulnerable and could be turned back against my friends, when I met Winterflower. It was easy to look the part when I already had those feelings in me.
2/21 23:06:24.894  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] mhm, never deviate to much from the truth

2/21 23:08:27.481  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: About...?
2/21 23:09:01.324  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] About the mission, about how you will react?
2/21 23:09:27.699  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Of course. I would be stupid to... not feel doubtful about it.
2/21 23:09:44.333  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: But I still feel what I said yesterday.
2/21 23:09:59.494  Vashíra-ArgentDawn nods slightly "alright. So you don't want to back down?"
2/21 23:10:19.527  Irrissia-ArgentDawn wraps her arms around her chest. "No matter what they may propose, I can't be tempted. It won't erase my memories, the pain will be the same for me."
2/21 23:10:31.057  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I don't have the choice, Vashira. I can't back down.
2/21 23:10:48.863  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Okay, then let us proceed, once we cross the border, you can't go back.
2/21 23:11:26.955  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Vashira Ravenheart.

2/21 23:11:39.533  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I know... But we need it.

2/21 23:12:11.610  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales deeply. "I really hope you're right."
2/21 23:12:24.700  Vashíra-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Don't deviate from who you are and you will be fine

2/21 23:15:19.987  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances to the Darkshore, and then to Vashira. "Ellemayne will know what to show."
2/21 23:15:43.174  Vashíra-ArgentDawn nods alittle "Goodluck Tessa, may the goddess watch over you and guide you trough this"
2/21 23:16:17.267  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Vashira Ravenheart, politely.
2/21 23:16:20.995  Vashíra bows before Irrissia.

2/21 23:22:05.491  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: ITs not a game afterall, its a world
2/21 23:22:08.785  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: as of tomorrow it'll be even better as this year they're fully reworking the base-game classes to be more customisable
2/21 23:22:18.120  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Auberdine is much like you left it, the holes and ruins still there. If you look around, there are no immediate signs of it being tampered with.
2/21 23:22:24.053  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Hi there
2/21 23:22:25.254  Irrissia-ArgentDawn finally arrives on the spot indicated by Winterflower. She looks around, nervous, before motionning her right hand to cast an arcane lightning, in the direction of the sky. She waits in silence, counting up to one hundred in her head.
2/21 23:22:34.734  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: the void subclasses are being updated tomorrow, then solar and arc (lightning) will be reworked in the seasonal patches
2/21 23:22:52.116  [4. LookingForGroup] Treasonable-ArgentDawn: im at the awkward stage on wow due to spending so much time on it I have too much "stuff" that just seems a shame to abandon it lol
2/21 23:22:54.387  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: and that's just free content f2p can access
2/21 23:23:23.582  [4. LookingForGroup] Treasonable-ArgentDawn: its like decorating and refurbishing a house over 17 years and then deciding to be homeless :D
2/21 23:23:34.079  [4. LookingForGroup] Eruantíen-ArgentDawn: I know the feeling Treasonable... its why I always end up bak on my druid...
2/21 23:23:35.208  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: it's honestly a good MMO-lite shooter, i've been playing Destiny sporarically since D1 beta
2/21 23:23:54.646  [4. LookingForGroup] Eruantíen-ArgentDawn: played it on PS back I dont know when
2/21 23:23:59.246  [4. LookingForGroup] Induuros-ArgentDawn: Thats a sunk cost fallacy Treasonable 
2/21 23:24:04.065  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The lightning crackles over the natural sounds from Auberdine and the surrounding forest. It stays quiet,as is the remnant of Teldrassil in the distance.
2/21 23:24:25.383  [4. LookingForGroup] Treasonable-ArgentDawn: I bought D2 on launch and played it a bit but never bought any of the DLC as I was basically playing alone all the time
2/21 23:24:37.716  [4. LookingForGroup] Treasonable-ArgentDawn: I went back onto it a few months back and had absolutely no idea what I was doing lol
2/21 23:24:49.250  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: it's pretty easy to find groups for harder content with discord servers and stuff
2/21 23:25:02.016  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: imagine thinking about other Games
2/21 23:25:06.816  [4. LookingForGroup] Malmuth-ArgentDawn: I tried playing it when it was on the Battle.net launcher, but my old PC was too slow.
2/21 23:25:09.283  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Heresay
2/21 23:25:12.816  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Heresy
2/21 23:25:24.877  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: i'm an unhinged psychopath who genuinely loves solo queue pvp 6s though
2/21 23:25:42.069  To |Kq17|k: Will you stick around until/if they come
2/21 23:25:50.114  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: (partly cuz i'm pretty decent at pvp)
2/21 23:25:50.542  Irrissia-ArgentDawn reaches one hundred in her mind, before casting another lightnings, and finally a third one. She lowers her hands and waits.
2/21 23:26:01.251  |Kq17|k whispers: She would give it some time.
2/21 23:26:24.778  [4. LookingForGroup] Ðvy-ArgentDawn: are you r1?
2/21 23:26:42.928  [4. LookingForGroup] Eruantíen-ArgentDawn: If I may ask.. what spec Moondew?
2/21 23:27:04.117  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: I'm talking about Destiny lmao I'm absolutely dogshit at wow pvp
2/21 23:27:16.432  [4. LookingForGroup] Ðvy-ArgentDawn: oh:#
2/21 23:27:19.759  [4. LookingForGroup] Eruantíen-ArgentDawn: oh hehe
2/21 23:27:52.998  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: In Destiny tho, I main solar titan
2/21 23:27:58.913  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: love those hammer throws
2/21 23:28:23.735  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It stays quiet for a good while, with only the sounds of nature surrounding this part of Auberdine. But then it grows more quiet and the birds and creatures stop making their sounds.
2/21 23:28:32.913  [4. LookingForGroup] Eruantíen-ArgentDawn: might fire it up again
2/21 23:29:04.046  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances around, warily. As the nature silent, her instinct kicks in. She crosses the water to reach the ruins and climbs in a corner to sit there, waiting less in the open.
2/21 23:29:25.120  [4. LookingForGroup] Moondew-ArgentDawn: it's fun chilled out imo
2/21 23:29:46.383  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Aye The Justicar
2/21 23:29:55.803  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: W/c

2/21 23:31:14.415  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Shortly after you see how 3 Humans come wandering in. They have the same rugged look as the others you saw before and they appear to be looking for you. They honed in on your original spot and quickly find you at your hiding spot.
2/21 23:31:48.065  Irrissia-ArgentDawn stands up, her hand on her bag, wary. She looks like a deer, about to dash away, depending of their answers.
2/21 23:33:10.945  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "What are you looking at?" One of the rugged men asks, stepping forwards. He has dirty brown hair and is armed, just like his friends.

2/21 23:37:02.166  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (You saw my answer ?)
2/21 23:37:03.879  To |Kq17|k: I was out of range from your last message xD
2/21 23:37:08.832  To |Kq17|k: I only just realised
2/21 23:37:10.615  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Ahah xD)
2/21 23:37:13.334  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I'm looking for Summerbreeze.
2/21 23:37:15.202  Irrissia-ArgentDawn observes the man, her gaze passing on his weapon, placing her bag slightly more behind her waistline, almost hidden under her cloak.
2/21 23:38:21.349  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "What is she to you?" *The men keep a clear eye on their surroundings, very cautious. *
2/21 23:38:53.818  Irrissia-ArgentDawn clenches her teeth softly at the question, nervous. "I...was... asked to bring her something."
2/21 23:39:53.906  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The man snorts, swiping back his hair.* "Didn't answer the question." *One of the others comes close and whispers to him:* "Surroundings seem clear."
2/21 23:40:19.322  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: That's what she is. I... know nothing else. Who are you ?
2/21 23:40:33.560  Irrissia-ArgentDawn hands tense up on the belt of her satchel.
2/21 23:42:04.224  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The man narrows his eyes, looking to Tessaemay. He steps a few paces closer to give you a closer look:* "What are you bringing?"
2/21 23:42:34.588  Irrissia-ArgentDawn squints as he approaches, ready to hop and flaps away before he could do anything. "...Documents."
2/21 23:43:52.153  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: remember the strange Highborne named Thala that seemed to be in love with Mak? She become very insistent and I had to take my distances from her, she was very unhealthy in her approaches. Now she is by the fire in Ashenvale
2/21 23:44:08.981  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: This is her ??
2/21 23:44:14.651  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Yesterday she said that she understood my will to part, and she was ok with it. I hope she is not following me
2/21 23:44:23.126  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I hope too.
2/21 23:44:29.687  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I saw her at the campfire when I was sneaking about
2/21 23:44:40.567  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Is she whispering you about it, or just is in the same place ?
2/21 23:44:54.881  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: for now no messages from her
2/21 23:45:05.856  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "You the one that did the lighting?"
2/21 23:45:07.237  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/21 23:45:09.576  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Maybe she just wanted to see how Ashenvale community was, after you mentionned it.
2/21 23:45:22.575  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly to that, still wary.
2/21 23:45:31.910  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: I hope, the last thing I need now after all the mess I lived through is a stalker
2/21 23:45:42.409  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: but maybe she is here just to see the community
2/21 23:45:53.276  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: If ever that's the case, tell me. And I'm going to have a talk with her, okey ?

2/21 23:46:01.889  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: But for now, I wouldn't jump on conclusions.
2/21 23:46:22.342  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: once they invade ukraine they better ban dem russians >:(
2/21 23:46:32.524  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: yea for now I will not jump to conclusions. She has every right to join the community, if she is here with good will
2/21 23:46:45.663  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Exactly.
2/21 23:46:52.173  [4. LookingForGroup] Ðvy-ArgentDawn: russian is already in ukraine to "keep the peace" was just on news, putin signed contracts for it etc
2/21 23:46:57.936  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "We'll take what you have." *He comes closer, more agresively this time and reaches out to try a grab.*
2/21 23:47:09.418  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: doubt that
2/21 23:47:14.423  [4. LookingForGroup] Hulkuphogan-ArgentDawn: ah yes, the peace panzers

2/21 23:47:33.090  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: he is trying to find reasons to start invading ukraine, which he is gonna make up on the spot
2/21 23:47:52.910  Irrissia-ArgentDawn jumps out of his range and shapes shift, flapping away, to reach another roof, before shapeshifting back, higher this time, hard to reach for someone without wings.
2/21 23:48:26.010  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "I'm giving those to Summerbreeze... or not at all." *She said, showing her fangs in threat.*
2/21 23:48:59.202  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "You didn't even tell what it is. Can be blank for all we know."
2/21 23:49:14.755  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "And you didn't say who you were neither."

2/21 23:50:27.613  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Nor you." *The red haired man counters. He signals his companions who form up with him, a little distance between them.*
2/21 23:50:41.568  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Biden released a statement that there was a leak about how Putin has a list of "To Kill" or "To send to Camp (GULAG)" for people inside Ukraine once its captured
2/21 23:51:03.267  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: LGBTQ+ was on that list too xD

2/21 23:52:19.702  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She looks at the men, glancing to find another point to flap, if any got on that roof, before answering.* "My friends... captured Winterflower. We discussed during his captivity." *She pauses, looking around a moment.* "I told me to look for someone »
2/21 23:52:19.702  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: » named Summerbreeze. The rest of the story is for them. And only them."

2/21 23:54:17.976  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "You have the notes?" *He suddenly looks a lot more interested, open to the idea even if he is supsicious still.* "Boss will pay extra for that." *One of his companions says*
2/21 23:54:57.944  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: If only NATO starts making a proper army
2/21 23:55:19.745  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay inhales deeply, to answer firmly.* "I will only speak with them. And only here."
2/21 23:55:46.501  [4. LookingForGroup] Dashaari-ArgentDawn: thought nato was set up to prevent war
2/21 23:55:57.968  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: With peace talk nad sanctions

2/22 19:54:21.718  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: ...Because I'm not sure how things will play out. And if I don't come back, I rather know they are safe with you.
2/22 19:54:33.184  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And not with Raven?
2/22 19:54:47.353  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Vashira ?

2/22 19:56:13.751  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I was speaking of Vashira, so you can be offended, if you want. But that will be for nothing.
2/22 19:56:20.839  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Ah, very well.
2/22 19:56:31.580  Irrissia-ArgentDawn approaches to embrace Thalyndrae.
2/22 19:56:47.710  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn reciprocates the embrace, tightening the grasp for a moment.
2/22 19:56:54.377  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "I'm about to do something you will disapprove... but don't hate me, promised ?"
2/22 19:57:02.078  Arandell-ArgentDawn eyes the note once more before folding it and tugging it under his surcoat for now. He then inclines his head towards Thalyndrae before sipping from his cup again.
2/22 19:57:10.611  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: ...I disapprove many things you do.

2/22 19:57:51.281  Irrissia-ArgentDawn observes a silent. "Maybe... a little."
2/22 19:57:59.281  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn squints her eyes at Tessaemay.
2/22 19:58:03.628  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Oh... crap. You two ignore the part about the note. He is just holding those at the moment then.
2/22 19:58:05.089  Irrissia-ArgentDawn releases Thalyndrae, stepping back.
2/22 19:58:24.349  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: xD I just imagine him folding the books in two, with a curse like "DAMMIT."

2/22 19:59:35.470  Arandell-ArgentDawn frowns briefly and balances the books and notes in one hand while carrying the teacup in another as he turns to head into the inn.
2/22 19:59:36.543  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Will Vashira be here tonight ?
2/22 19:59:44.653  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Why do you have the name of a Frozen city

2/22 20:07:17.234  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Nitzuss Nimblewind, politely.
2/22 20:07:33.712  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Nitzuss.
2/22 20:07:36.423  Irrissia is already in a group.
2/22 20:07:42.435  You have invited Nitzuss to join your group.
2/22 20:07:45.641  Nitzuss has joined the raid group.
2/22 20:07:55.434  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Nitzuss.
2/22 20:08:04.424  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn inclines her form gently.
2/22 20:08:05.010  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Dalathria.
2/22 20:08:05.812  You have invited Lyndraé to join your group.
2/22 20:08:07.165  Dalathria-ArgentDawn bows her head.
2/22 20:08:07.659  Lyndraé has joined the raid group.
2/22 20:08:38.043  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let's discuss in the townhall. This is not the place.
2/22 20:08:47.543  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/22 20:08:53.072  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Lead the way.
2/22 20:09:05.495  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Nothing good ever comes from the hall...
2/22 20:09:26.760  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Then, it's the perfect place...
2/22 20:09:41.724  Arandell-ArgentDawn mumbles underhis breath.
2/22 20:09:52.863  Irrissia-ArgentDawn inhales deeply, and joins her hands.
2/22 20:10:12.010  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What did you learn, Tessaemay?
2/22 20:10:14.630  Arandell-ArgentDawn sips from his cup of tea.
2/22 20:10:26.364  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: If I can summarise briefly the begining for everyone to understand...
2/22 20:10:41.051  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Please.
2/22 20:10:57.929  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I had a little discussion with Winterflower. I played the part of a distressed and easily manipulable youngling.
2/22 20:11:08.094  Irrissia-ArgentDawn turns slightly to look at the gathered.
2/22 20:11:52.408  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn smirks at Tessaemay sideways.
2/22 20:11:53.377  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It worked very well, as he explained me how to get in contact with other people working with him. In something they call the Observatory. I don't know much about it, except that's likely where their leader, an highborne named Willowsheart, lead the »
2/22 20:11:54.075  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: » researches.
2/22 20:12:31.741  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn raises her eyebrows faintly. "Willowsheart? Andissiel Willowsheart?"
2/22 20:12:31.977  Thyreena has come online.
2/22 20:12:44.952  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: She didn't say his name.
2/22 20:13:01.142  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Interesting...
2/22 20:13:11.866  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Who's that person...?
2/22 20:14:01.301  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: He's one of the Shen'dralar, or... was. He was one of the first to journey to Darnassus to ask for reconcilliation. Something happened there, because he renounced all his great, might I add, wealth and status to live in Darnassus. 
2/22 20:14:10.100  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Afterwards, he left again to live in Winterspring. We haven't heard from him since.
2/22 20:14:12.834  Rethion has come online.
2/22 20:14:31.032  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "Well... Maybe then. Or they just share a common name."
2/22 20:14:40.431  Lyndraé shrugs at Irrissia. Who knows?
2/22 20:14:57.866  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Maybe he fell in love with the kaldorei. It'd explain why he'd try to prevent the Burning.
2/22 20:15:14.132  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Perhaps...
2/22 20:15:25.798  Arandell-ArgentDawn rolls his eyes before sipping from his cup again.
2/22 20:15:30.367  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: But, well... Yesterday, I met one of their group, a woman called Summerbreeze. I brought her a fragment of what we found, to prove my desire to help them. She was reluctant to reveal any information, so I decided to not push too far. She was with a »
2/22 20:15:31.099  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: » couple of mercenaries, and I wouldn't have be able to escape, if they decided to attack.
2/22 20:16:59.901  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I pretended to need a way to be extracted from our group, if I accepted to collaborate, hoping she would reveal me a better place to meet, but she was smart enough to not fall in that trap. However... I did convinced her to meet me again, at the same »
2/22 20:17:00.833  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: » place, in Auberdine. I pretended that stealing the rest of the information would get me caught by all of you, and I would probably be followed.
2/22 20:18:21.601  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: So... I made a copy of what we found, with slight differences to not give them anything, no matter how this trap play out. The goal would be to capture her. I doubt she would be manipulable like Winterflowers, but... I know we have other methods to »
2/22 20:18:22.299  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: » gather informations from our prisonners.
2/22 20:19:18.215  |Kq3|k whispers: How many mercenaries, yesterday ? I counted 4, but I'm not sure.
2/22 20:19:45.692  To |Kq3|k: 3
2/22 20:19:56.258  |Kq3|k whispers: Eh, almost good ! Ty
2/22 20:21:12.892  Yier has come online.
2/22 20:21:39.624  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: So... that's about it. I ran there, pretending I managed to get the notes, you ambush her and likely three other mercenaries... And I play the poor terrified youngling until you managed to get her. And hopefully, if you capture her, maybe she will »
2/22 20:21:40.283  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: » agree to reveal more. I don't know, probably if I have the opportunity to flee with the books, she could accept to reveal me where to go. *She scratches her cheek, thinking out loud.*
2/22 20:21:57.665  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Anyway. I guess you all hate that plan ?
2/22 20:22:11.707  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: This Summerbreeze... what is she? Another Chronomancer? A Mercenary?
2/22 20:22:26.899  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: One of Willowsheart researcher.
2/22 20:22:41.954  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: How can we be sure she knows more than him?
2/22 20:23:29.897  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: She promised me to take me to safety, if I brough her the notes. So I bet she know "where" are the others. WInterflower said she was the one supervising the mercenaris for Willowsheart.
2/22 20:23:42.077  Arandell-ArgentDawn frowns a little as he drinks what remains of his tea and walks backwards over to the bench to leave the cup on it.
2/22 20:24:37.840  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I suppose that's one of our only leads.
2/22 20:24:56.968  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Unless someone had one they didn't share ?
2/22 20:25:02.409  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at the others, hopeful.
2/22 20:25:16.733  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So, we know where Summerbreeze will be. There is another place in Darkshore that they occupy and should find.
2/22 20:25:23.117  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/22 20:25:35.417  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Not sure it's in the Darkshore. But there is another place, yes.
2/22 20:26:07.309  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Other option is the cartel, but that is worser lead.
2/22 20:26:16.935  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and nods.
2/22 20:26:56.513  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: If what Winterflower said was true -and it was so far- the cartel don't know anything, except how to contact them. And by them, he clearly meant Summerbreeze.
2/22 20:27:26.341  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So, should we go about the situation? We know where Summerbreeze will be.
2/22 20:27:54.741  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Would assume they might know some locations, but that likely all and how much it would take to learn anything even remotely of value.
2/22 20:28:26.206  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: She will be waiting for me. If I don't show up tonight, she may believe that I either got caught, or that I betrayed her.
2/22 20:28:37.469  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So poor ambush it is, hmm?
2/22 20:28:41.329  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: She will be suspicious, but likely less than she would be normally.
2/22 20:28:59.142  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Nyooom!
2/22 20:28:59.853  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods gently, "Great work, Tessaemay. I asked around discretely about Greensnow, apparently she is dearly spoken of by the elves who know of her. She sat on the council of Lordanel and now of Auberdine. I found some outstanding bills with Evelook »
2/22 20:28:59.853  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn » markings as well, for what it's worth."
2/22 20:29:00.274  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She might well head back to said hideout.
2/22 20:29:04.809  You have invited Alyssrea to join your group.
2/22 20:29:07.217  Alyssrea has joined the raid group.
2/22 20:29:10.159  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: As I said I could be followed, I believe it was enough to convince her she could rely on me.
2/22 20:29:21.376  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And then, we could follow her, or track her down;
2/22 20:29:36.161  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Dalathria and Nitzuss are hunters, Thalyndrae can track portals.
2/22 20:29:55.886  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Nitzuss Nimblewind.
2/22 20:30:02.223  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods.
2/22 20:30:19.599  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Greensnow can be another lead to follow, if we know where she is ?
2/22 20:30:53.615  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She should be arriving in Darkshore soon.
2/22 20:30:56.647  Arlièn-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Alyssrea.
2/22 20:31:03.878  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Good fortune, Sister.
2/22 20:31:08.056  Arandell-ArgentDawn inclines his head towards Alyssrea.
2/22 20:31:10.259  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Then we can focus on Summerbreeze tonight.
2/22 20:31:10.292  Nitzuss bows before Alyssrea.
2/22 20:31:25.272  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn inclines her head respectfully. "Blessed evening."
2/22 20:31:37.747  Dalathria-ArgentDawn inclines her head to Alyssrea.
2/22 20:31:37.747  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Agreed.
2/22 20:31:42.271  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Alyssrea Whispershot, politely.
2/22 20:32:11.671  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I have to go to that meeting anyway. But if they take me to "safety" I have no way to know if I will be able to escape. And that's a risk I think no one will aggree to take...
2/22 20:32:26.376  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Summerbreeze, one of the magi that is working on this project of theirs, will be in Auberdine tonight, where Tessaemay lured her.
2/22 20:32:46.813  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums to Alyssrea, abreviating what was discussed so far.
2/22 20:32:56.363  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It may still come to that, if we only track her now.
2/22 20:32:58.605  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn listens intently.
2/22 20:33:25.003  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do we want to capture or track is the question?
2/22 20:33:39.582  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: We can try both ?
2/22 20:33:57.818  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Not reveal the ambush when I meet her in Auberdine, but you follow from afar, until we reach an interresting place ?
2/22 20:34:02.441  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I was just thinking of the alternative. If Tessaemay does not show up, she would go back again. We would not have to risk her.
2/22 20:34:25.404  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Greedy to do both, but possible.
2/22 20:34:32.338  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It would require a certain amount of stealth.
2/22 20:34:41.201  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: It will break my cover. The idea is to keep it up as long as possible, to have her reveal any information in last minute, in hope I'm really on her side.
2/22 20:35:33.942  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do you think you could convince her you're on her side, if she managed to elude capture from the rest of us, yet captured you?
2/22 20:36:31.372  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I don't plan to intefer during the capture, until the point when you restrained her. As I said, I want to keep my cover up as long as possible. So even if you fail, I wouldn't have done anything against her.
2/22 20:36:54.179  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You won't miss any talent from me anyway. I'm still a mender, I wouldn't have been very helpful.
2/22 20:37:06.147  Makhalann has come online.
2/22 20:37:21.924  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: evening.
2/22 20:37:23.217  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: When you start the ambush, I will do what I would do if I really betrayed you : Run away as fast as I can. I said I risked to get in prison for that.
2/22 20:37:25.803  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Heyooo
2/22 20:37:26.165  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: heyhey
2/22 20:37:31.057  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: hey makh!
2/22 20:37:45.673  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods once, "Good."
2/22 20:38:00.698  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arandell, what do you think of this?
2/22 20:38:14.384  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It leaves Ravenshade as only one to prevent escape by arcane means.
2/22 20:38:21.784  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You can even try to capture me to add to the realism. *She shrugs idly*
2/22 20:38:29.147  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Thalyndrae Ravenshade.
2/22 20:38:36.150  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: True, but it's her speciality, right ?
2/22 20:38:57.053  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Do you want me to prevent her escaping by magic or let her escape and then track her?
2/22 20:39:01.370  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Well, it is tricky to just follow. Capturing right away likely most likely to succeed. Tracking close enough to still maybe ambush is bit... risky.
2/22 20:39:15.780  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arandell and Arlien, after Thalyndrae's question.
2/22 20:39:20.944  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Also means Ravenshade has to prevent us being detected by magic as well.
2/22 20:39:35.042  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: do I look like a swiss army knife to you
2/22 20:39:45.886  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes. Usefull tool.
2/22 20:39:52.622  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I mean. He isn't wrong
2/22 20:39:56.672  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Our goal for tonight it to find this location. So tracking.
2/22 20:40:10.859  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Szonglei-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/22 20:40:15.840  Lyndraé nods at you.
2/22 20:40:20.617  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Very well.
2/22 20:40:22.122  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There's also no certainity she will reveal anything to us even if captured, judging by her zeal I would not be too surprised.
2/22 20:40:35.805  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But then we have methods as you said, Tessa.
2/22 20:40:40.565  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We could break her. But takes time.
2/22 20:41:12.041  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods slowly, lips thinned.
2/22 20:41:19.993  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: The "poor manipulable youngling" method is out, however. Unless you capture me with her and toss me in the same cell. But that would also look very stupid of you.
2/22 20:41:36.955  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mumbles. "And I don't really like that idea..."
2/22 20:41:53.866  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We still have Winterflower.
2/22 20:42:05.840  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Eitherway, tracking as priority it is then. Not that I like the idea too much. We might have to leave Tessa there.
2/22 20:42:09.139  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Speaking of, has she spoken?
2/22 20:42:28.904  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] This is my proposal:
2/22 20:42:36.904  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods at Alyssrea, "He's the one who lead Tessa to Summerbreeze."
2/22 20:42:46.627  Alyssrea nods at Nitzuss.
2/22 20:42:48.495  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I could try another visit, if Summerbreeze got captured and put in another cell. I will need a good story. *She scratches her chin.* Something to think later anyway.
2/22 20:42:59.296  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Tessaemay, you head there. Panicked, knowing that we are comming.
2/22 20:43:05.258  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/22 20:43:41.416  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We will be following shortly, to put time preasure onto her. If she acts hastily, she might lead us to the hideout.
2/22 20:43:57.407  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] If she doesn't, we have a shot at capturing her there.
2/22 20:44:16.442  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/22 20:44:37.624  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So... all we do is announce her we are coming instead of suprising her that we are coming?
2/22 20:44:42.027  Arandell-ArgentDawn raises an eyebrow.
2/22 20:45:12.911  You have invited Makhalann to join your group.
2/22 20:45:15.409  Makhalann has joined the raid group.
2/22 20:45:16.309  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I can tell her that I saw someone go where we were used to keep the book, and I fear you are already on your way out to find me.
2/22 20:45:27.465  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Yes, in an attempt to corner her into a foolish and rash decision, I presume.
2/22 20:45:33.136  Makhalann-ArgentDawn approaches, offering a silent nod of greeting.
2/22 20:45:44.579  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] That I hope, yes.
2/22 20:45:50.592  Arlièn-ArgentDawn incliens her head to Makhalann
2/22 20:46:02.129  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Wich would be done, if we fail to be undetected.
2/22 20:46:02.129  Irrissia-ArgentDawn bows her head at Makhalann Warpath, politely.
2/22 20:46:05.057  Nitzuss bows before Makhalann.
2/22 20:46:23.957  |Hchannel:-1439721888|h[Nathannual]|h Moderation privileges given to (null).

2/22 20:46:28.087  Arandell-ArgentDawn dips his head towards Makhalann.
2/22 20:47:35.277  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Very well, no panic then. But we do have to leave before long or we miss the window of oppurtunity.
2/22 20:47:43.632  Nitzuss nods at you.
2/22 20:47:45.453  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: And get very, very late.
2/22 20:47:51.283  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: ^^
2/22 20:48:10.328  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: I should already be on my way, I must be there before you, remember ?
2/22 20:48:23.746  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And it would be safer to not travel with you. If ever she got eyes in the forest...
2/22 20:48:31.635  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: This is why planning is not great for the day the event is on. Just solid brief without suggestions is much better timewise.
2/22 20:48:59.541  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You fly there. We will follow, I arranged for hippogryphs to bring us to the camp where we met before.
2/22 20:49:04.179  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I do what I can, okey ;-; Took me some time to get there.
2/22 20:49:12.379  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods softly at Arlièn Snowshade.
2/22 20:49:38.553  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: Then... I will see you all later. And remember... I won't fight back, so don't aim for the head.
2/22 20:49:45.153  Makhalann-ArgentDawn listens quietly, folding his arms
2/22 20:49:55.404  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: I would have still so many questions about the location. :D

2/22 20:50:14.456  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn pricks a finger with the tip of her Ironwood Dagger and wipes it with a piece of cloth, holding the Bloodstained Handkerchief out to Tessaemay if she would take it, "For »

2/22 20:50:50.582  Irrissia-ArgentDawn takes the handkerchief and pockets it with a nod.
2/22 20:50:57.622  Nitzuss nods at Irrissia.
2/22 20:51:10.680  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shapeshifts, and flaps away.
2/22 20:51:47.036  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Let's make our way to the camp as well. There we can split up and approach the city.

2/22 20:54:14.689  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not a horrible idea.

2/22 20:54:53.906  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I am not a 100% sure if we get to the point that i hoped to reach
2/22 20:55:07.805  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (When we would get timeloss ?)
2/22 20:55:12.142  Makhalann-ArgentDawn growls low, shifting into a big owl. Feathers shaded in a deep purple hue, sharp beak and two imposing horns of Ironwood.

2/22 21:03:02.340  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods once.

2/22 21:03:55.422  Lyndraé nods at you.
2/22 21:03:59.874  Makhalann-ArgentDawn hums, and nods
2/22 21:04:23.193  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Aim to take out the mercenaries first, and capture the Summerbreeze. She is our top priority.
2/22 21:04:57.674  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Possible problem, my arm is a bloody beacon of runes and enchantments. Got no way hiding that from anyone.
2/22 21:05:26.336  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Makhalann with Dalthria instead then. Stay quiet.
2/22 21:05:32.959  Arandell-ArgentDawn nods.

2/22 21:06:08.319  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: That was only an excuse so Arandell can stay with Thal and slicey slice
2/22 21:06:34.927  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Or maybe he doesn't want to leave highborne with Arlien. :P
2/22 21:07:20.583  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: But nah. He got a fancy arm now, it needs to have few drawbacks too. :)
2/22 21:07:33.609  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal seeks to cast a very small aura around herself and Arandell, trying to mask their Arcane aura.*
2/22 21:07:46.324  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: It takes a little while again, once the lighting disturbed the sky. They take their time, but then three persons come on over from a distance, Summerbreeze and two human mercs.
2/22 21:08:41.895  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: No friendly fire during missions. We do accidents on our freetime.

2/22 21:12:06.632  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss and Alyssrea find their way winding around the outskirts of Auberdine, approaching the bridge unnoticed as far as they are concerned. They take position just east of the bridge, overlooking it with eyes towards town center.*
2/22 21:12:27.611  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *She nods at Summerbreeze, following eagerly, a nervous glance around, to make her sure they aren't followed.*
2/22 21:12:32.588  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *low* There's Tessa.

2/22 21:13:41.494  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: In the distance, you see how Tessaemay quickly talks with the Kaldorei and two humans. After a brief chat, they quickly leave in a similar direction as the Dwarf did before.
2/22 21:14:14.909  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay follows eagerly. She looks like a scared cat, her hands holding on the satchel, nervously.*
2/22 21:15:30.365  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: "I will leave it up to you, to give a signal if we must." *Arlièn says to you.*
2/22 21:15:54.726  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *slowly drops lower hiding behind the tree to keep out of view mostly*
2/22 21:15:58.889  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Just giving it a little bit of time so the others can talk and move too.)

2/22 21:16:42.331  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea mumbles a quiet prayer to the Goddess for the shadows to keep her and Nitz from attracting unwanted attention while they were stalking their prey*

2/22 21:20:22.810  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: (Okay.)
2/22 21:20:38.907  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Summerbreeze hands you a red rod, engraved with silver: "You will need this."

2/22 21:34:23.702  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay inhales deeply, glancing in her back as they approache the waterfall, presenting a expression of relief.*
2/22 21:34:24.775  Dalathria receives loot: Stringy Loins.
2/22 21:34:25.161  Dalathria receives loot: Matted Pelt.
2/22 21:34:26.749  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You see how Tessaemay is being lead towards a waterfall, what appears to be solid rock. The Humans look around for a moment, and then they all dispaer.
2/22 21:34:34.707  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Totally agree...I have had the name Nash for about 12 years now ;)
2/22 21:35:07.077  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea looks towards Nitzuss and mumbles* "Did you see that?"
2/22 21:35:22.873  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: *widens his eye, huffing*
2/22 21:35:25.259  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Bloody hell, then again it was never chosen by me.
2/22 21:35:31.605  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (provided you have the rods)
2/22 21:35:36.984  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: (Yep)
2/22 21:35:47.157  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Correction 15 years xD
2/22 21:36:03.427  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: The entrance to the cavern is obscured with an illusion, blending it in with the natural rock. Behind a barricade there are a two more guards looking out, goblins.
2/22 21:36:13.570  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/22 21:36:21.048  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: On the ledge to your right there is a wooden structure, boarded up part of the cavern. The way down has been carved out to form a staircase at parts, supplementing the natural slope.
2/22 21:36:27.281  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Looking down below you see a round table in what seems to be a meeting room. There is a small tree in a large pot.
2/22 21:36:52.314  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss nods. She surveys the area quickly for any obvious threats before slowly treading up the path.*
2/22 21:37:00.278  Dalathria-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* Not anymore. Seem to have disappeared. Some form of spell?
2/22 21:37:03.007  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: But I will keep listening to Vash, no worries!
2/22 21:37:10.098  Makhalann-ArgentDawn nods "Probably"
2/22 21:37:11.580  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *She tries to relax, looking around to detail the place, before muttering slowly.* "Is it safe...?"
2/22 21:37:12.439  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: It's an illusion which the rods seem to dispell.

2/22 21:37:55.310  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "You did well."
2/22 21:38:14.134  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *She gently nods at Summerbreeze, following.*
2/22 21:38:33.675  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: You hear faint noices from inside.
2/22 21:39:10.030  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Summerbreeze leads you down, but the guards they stay behind. The goblins call out with some panic. "THey are here!"
2/22 21:39:13.475  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: This better be last and first time I need to discuss about rods as keys in any detail.
2/22 21:39:21.880  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: lmao
2/22 21:39:26.223  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Euh?
2/22 21:40:22.432  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Summerbreeze looks to you, asking sternly: "Did you lead them here?"
2/22 21:40:33.346  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nods and keeps looking at their surroundings.
2/22 21:40:44.410  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *Tessaemay glances at the up of the cave, nervously placing a hand on Summerbreeze* "N-no ! You h-have to hide me ! I-... I will get... killed for that..."
2/22 21:40:53.697  Arandell-ArgentDawn speaks quietly. "Ravenshade will try to open the way. Rest be ready to move in or storm them, if they notice us."
2/22 21:41:02.387  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *Her eyes are widdened in fear, her ears lowered on her head, completly terrified.*
2/22 21:41:21.515  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *The men upstairs are  aiming rifles at the entrance, waiting for what might come through the illusion.
2/22 21:41:34.573  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (Also, you have multiple rods)
2/22 21:41:36.728  Arandell-ArgentDawn adds after a moment. "And if there is twenty we may run to the other direction instead."
2/22 21:42:08.280  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *Tessaemay looks at the men and remains completly quiet about it, still playing her terrified part.*
2/22 21:42:31.014  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn nods.
2/22 21:42:40.537  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: 5 in total
2/22 21:42:56.264  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Arcane magic hangs heavy in the air, leaving a static experience. The signs of temporal magic are not as present as they were after use at Auberdine, but it is certainly here.
2/22 21:43:13.675  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal moves to the wall with one of the rods in hand and places it closer, curious if it has any effects.*
2/22 21:43:14.694  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: There is a table in the center. There are a few scattered documents on them. The tree has a central place in the room. It is a small version of Teldrassil, including a miniature version of Darnassus and Rutheran. Prayer candles stand around its edge.
2/22 21:43:59.176  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Pressing her back against the rocky mountainside, Nitzuss digs her toes into the ground ready to spring forward*
2/22 21:44:03.080  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You look through the illusion without any difficulty. The others still see rock
2/22 21:44:16.812  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You do however spot four guns aimed at you, please roll.
2/22 21:44:28.926  Lyndraé rolls 96 (1-100)
2/22 21:44:36.299  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You dodge all of them.
2/22 21:44:37.171  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *She glances upstaires, swallowing hardly, muttering.* "W-what do... we do ?"
2/22 21:44:49.559  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: Do the others hear them?
2/22 21:45:05.376  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Gunshots rang out as Thalyndrae approaches the waterfall.
2/22 21:45:29.024  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thalyndrae is fortunate to have chronomatic enchantments as she dodges all the shots and staggers back.*
2/22 21:46:11.897  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: All shots miss, but it is unmistakable now that you have been noticed. The men inside reload and aim again, but the amount of firepower could not have been more than a handfull.
2/22 21:47:18.630  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "Xaxas" *Summerbreeze will try to take your books, forcefully.*
2/22 21:47:50.467  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Ugh. Makhalann, with me. Rest of you better land your shots right after.
2/22 21:47:54.008  Rethion has come online.
2/22 21:47:59.959  Nitzuss gently pats Arandell.
2/22 21:48:01.107  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *Tessaemay hiddens her books in her satchel, as Summerbreeze tries to take it from her, she pushes her back, escaping a panicked one.* "You said I would be safe if I was helping you !"
2/22 21:48:03.062  Makhalann-ArgentDawn nods at Arandell "I'm ready when you are"
2/22 21:48:22.613  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *panicked wine
2/22 21:48:24.537  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "Stop playing your game. Give me the books."
2/22 21:48:27.577  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] On your mark.
2/22 21:48:33.211  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal takes out four rods from her satchel and tosses one to Arandell, Nitzuss, Alyssrea and Dalathria.*
2/22 21:48:37.844  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Here, take these, it will dispell the illusion.
2/22 21:48:50.965  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal gives her last oen to Makhalann.*
2/22 21:49:01.762  Nitzuss nods at Lyndraé.
2/22 21:49:03.082  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: "I'm playing no game !" *Tessaemay takes another step back her ears low, glancing upstaire too, as if she really terrified by the idea of the other getting inside*
2/22 21:49:03.853  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The moment you catch the rod, it glows for a moment and the illusion is gone.
2/22 21:49:05.908  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks at Thal, taking the rod "Thanks" 
2/22 21:49:17.720  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Is there an actually path on my right, IC ?)
2/22 21:49:22.033  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *takes one of the rods and nods. "Can you shield us a bit?"
2/22 21:49:31.777  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Both tunnels are blocked by doors
2/22 21:49:36.545  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Sad)
2/22 21:49:39.347  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: There are two doors to either side, which are closed. To the side of the door there are a few clossets of Kaldorei make. There are also a number of boxes that show signs of packing.
2/22 21:49:45.544  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "It's all I can do as I can't see through the illusion anymore." *as she nods*
2/22 21:50:17.359  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Closed, as locked or just closed ? x)
2/22 21:50:17.943  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *quickly takes out his pistol and nods. "Well, ready? They will be."
2/22 21:50:37.942  |Kq46|k whispers: hi friend. how are you
2/22 21:50:39.473  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Locked
2/22 21:50:44.103  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Super sad)
2/22 21:50:49.130  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: *barks a bitter laugh* Eager to meet them
2/22 21:51:45.681  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: "You have to take us out of here !" *She babbles her words, the terror breaking her voice here and there, but she keeps her hands on her satchel, firmly. She won't let her only money get stolen from her before being taken to safety.*
2/22 21:51:48.566  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *grins at Makhalann. "Let us not hold you from it then. Move."*
2/22 21:51:52.557  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Summerbreeze is not taking no for an answer and she makes a gesture that you recognise from Thalyndrae. She speeds up? Or do you slow down? Either way, she comes in a blur to take the satchel and rumage through it for the books.*
2/22 21:51:57.969  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss draws an arrow and readies it on her low held bow.*
2/22 21:52:12.843  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *Starts running through the removed illusion after he spoke*
2/22 21:52:19.381  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: *grips the heavy mace with both hands, striding towards the entrance*

2/22 21:52:49.520  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: I regret the choices been made here.
2/22 21:52:53.724  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *Tessaemay satchel is enchanted with bottomless spell. Hard to find anything quickly in this, unless you know exactly what you're looking for.*
2/22 21:53:04.449  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: What were you planning?
2/22 21:53:10.939  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: You should.
2/22 21:53:14.492  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *Tessaemay tries to break the spell on her, or on Summerbreeze, to recover her satchel before the books escapes her posession.*
2/22 21:53:25.525  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (An arcane barrier in between the two and the four sharpshooters so they can shoot and then she'd drop it once htey reload)
2/22 21:53:45.788  To |Kq46|k: Doing good, in the middle of a event though so bit busy ;-)
2/22 21:53:48.474  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Make a roll

2/22 21:54:03.850  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: In my defense
2/22 21:54:05.279  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Arandell, you too please.
2/22 21:54:07.340  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Here was your chance!
2/22 21:54:10.813  Arandell rolls 18 (1-100)
2/22 21:54:22.041  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: sorry I rolled a 20, I need to roll a 100?
2/22 21:54:30.319  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I can multiply, don't worry
2/22 21:54:36.032  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: (kk)
2/22 21:54:58.466  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (Never ask to reroll after scoring that well. ;))
2/22 21:55:05.910  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: So, Vash is the sole survivor of the Hermitage now?
2/22 21:55:24.103  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Gunshots rang once more through the cave, blasting towards Makhalann and Arandell. Thalyndrae's attempt at a shield flashes but the illusion interferes and fails to protect.
2/22 21:55:38.551  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Nah, just the males being meatshields. You may run out of them...
2/22 21:56:07.186  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: But Makhalann shurgs off the two bullets that were aimed at him, the projectiles bouncing of the rocks. Arandell is not as lucky though and the bullets find their target.
2/22 21:56:12.331  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: I can multiply lol :P
2/22 21:56:13.837  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You may act now!
2/22 21:57:03.481  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: the shooter are at Star right?
2/22 21:57:10.424  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *You freeze in place. The mage grumbles another curse and takes your books before she regains her compurse.
2/22 21:57:16.687  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Each of the markers is a shooter
2/22 21:57:18.903  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Pushes off from the cliff-face as the tumult erupts and gets into position at the entrance, pulling the string of her bow taut before guiding the arrow nocked to it toward {Star}, firing a steady shot*
2/22 21:58:18.139  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *The books are perfectly identic to those she could expect. Only the content is different. One tiny error there, a slight mispelled word here, again and again, to make this completly unusable, without being suspect for everyone just glancing at those.*
2/22 21:58:19.315  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There are {star} and {square} are goblins, {diamond} and {triangle} are human. They sit behind makeshift baricades and are reloading
2/22 21:59:04.685  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She takes the books and then heads towards the other door, leaving through it. You are still stuck in place.
2/22 21:59:05.154  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *stopped as soon as he passed the waterfall trying to aim a quick shot, wich seems to have been rather sever mistake as he is greeted by two bullets digging into him through the armor, unable to fire and stumbling and dropping on one knee.*
2/22 21:59:18.290  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: charges through, letting out a crude howl are projectiles bounces against him: his face cracks into a feral grin while he tries to smash heavily against the barricades {star}, wielding his weapon in wide arcs to damage them
2/22 22:00:02.919  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: *Tessaemay tries to break her spell on herself, using her knowledge about curses to find a way throught the spellcraft. If sucessfull, the first thing she would do, before running after Summerbreeze, is recover her satchel.*
2/22 22:00:29.303  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: And this is the reason why it is very stupid to tell people we are coming after them. :P
2/22 22:00:37.448  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Moves to the entrance and takes cover from behind the uneven doorway as she aims at {square}. She mumbles a quiet prayer to the Goddess to guide her shots before she releases a poisoned arrow. If it would it, it would also apply a paralytic poison, a »
2/22 22:00:37.448  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: » dose which would be non-lethal but dull her target's senses*
2/22 22:00:48.418  Káthene has come online.
2/22 22:01:16.602  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You are still stuck. As though some greater force is at play to keep you here! To find a way to reunite you with the others...
2/22 22:01:45.686  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Is that a DM joke ? xD)
2/22 22:03:01.374  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Makhalann smashes the baricade with ease, the cover gone and nitzuss arrow finds the Goblin. It topples over gravely injured.
2/22 22:03:27.079  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Makh smash!!!
2/22 22:03:42.556  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Alyssrea's arrow finds her mark as well, and the human slumps to the ground with a dazed look.
2/22 22:04:01.997  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Yes :-P just so you know it is not something you really can change now
2/22 22:04:14.942  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: (Does the greater force at play give me enough time to afk and go grab a drink ? xD)
2/22 22:04:19.621  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Must be
2/22 22:04:28.829  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Good. Afk than

2/22 22:05:17.618  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: {triangle} did finish up reloading though, and he stumbles back from Makhalann's ferocity. He does take another shot at him while he falls backwards.
2/22 22:06:04.291  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Back !
2/22 22:06:19.275  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: {Diamond} fires blindly into the water fall. (Nitzuss, Dalathria, make me an unluck roll). it then throws the rifle away and runs down
2/22 22:06:27.813  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Makhalann roll to dodge

2/22 22:07:21.654  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: (when people are asked to do unluck rolls, dice brings luck)
2/22 22:07:34.376  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The bullet aimed at Makhalann also misses by a wide angle.
2/22 22:08:00.270  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You may act again
2/22 22:08:38.054  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: (had you rolled under 10, it would have hit you)

2/22 22:10:47.749  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *moves into the cave with her bow ready as she notices {diamond} run off. She takes a look around on the other side for injured, hostile or friendly, and potential traps around*
2/22 22:12:45.500  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss presses the building advantage, quickly drawing another arrow while moving fowards behind Alyssrea, before {diamond} comes into her sights. She lets loose, "Worm!", aiming to kill.*
2/22 22:12:56.153  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: *Dalathria steps in with her bow fully drawn. She sets her gaze upon {Diamond} and releases the arrow, aiming towards {Diamond}'s backside.*
2/22 22:13:17.758  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: You glance around but spot no traps.
2/22 22:13:28.482  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal journeys the others into the cave, dropping her hood and conjuring a spellsword.*
2/22 22:13:47.893  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No traps around... All clear?
2/22 22:14:15.800  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The {triangle} man has his head caved in, and falls to the floor with a cracked skull. The running {diamond} goblin is hit in the back, and falls forwads, rolling down to the bottom of the stairs.
2/22 22:14:41.382  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: On the ledge to your right there is a wooden structure, boarded up part of the cavern. The way down has been carved out to form a staircase at parts, supplementing the natural slope.
2/22 22:14:47.795  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Looking down below you see a round table in what seems to be a meeting room. There is a small tree in a large pot.
2/22 22:15:21.876  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You are out of initiative, you may act freely again.
2/22 22:15:48.961  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: pants, spitting on the ground. He leans on his mace, looking at the others to check
2/22 22:16:04.398  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: {square} is the door to the woorden structure.
2/22 22:16:15.952  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn looks to Arandell.
2/22 22:16:36.204  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *Arlièn who is still here, but odly quiet and useless till this point, comes on over to help mend Arandell when the fighting is done.*
2/22 22:17:09.816  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Arcane magic hangs heavy in the air, leaving a static experience. The signs of temporal magic are not as present as they were after use at Auberdine, but it is certainly here. You feel an active spell from below though
2/22 22:17:17.499  Arandell-ArgentDawn is in a process of cursing and bleeding quite a bit. Searching for some bits of bandages from his pouches on his belt.
2/22 22:17:39.519  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: A memory flashes. You feel time fall.
2/22 22:18:14.495  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Press on, see if there is any more danger.
2/22 22:18:25.968  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn closes her eyes and puts a hand at her temple. "There is heavy spellwork being done bellow. Whatever they're doing, it's shifting the flow of time here."
2/22 22:18:42.018  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Then stop wasting time. Move it.
2/22 22:18:44.520  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* I don't like the sound of that... 
2/22 22:18:51.550  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: You spy Tessaemay. But she is not moving
2/22 22:19:20.511  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: You did not say you were comming....tell me you didn't!
2/22 22:19:22.316  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: *Arlièn heals Arandell, so he can continue*
2/22 22:19:38.369  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *Alyssrea takes a look downwards, laying low to remain unseen*
2/22 22:19:45.362  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: As long as she stops him from bleeding to death. :P
2/22 22:20:25.519  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Tessa did even when we decided not. As far as I understood. :P
2/22 22:20:27.552  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It is quiet once more. The only thing you spot is a Tessaemay, but she is not moving. In fact, she is perfectly still.
2/22 22:20:49.843  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Listen.
2/22 22:20:51.972  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Listeeeen.
2/22 22:20:54.872  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ...
2/22 22:20:55.971  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Do you have a rock?
2/22 22:20:59.205  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: It's Arandell fault.
2/22 22:21:11.599  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Lucky for her Aran doesn't know it. Otherwise he owes two bullets in her. :P
2/22 22:21:12.414  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Vash is not around and this is what happenes?
2/22 22:21:13.157  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn looks to her left towards Nitz and Thaly and waves her hand slowly, then pointing towards Tessa. 
2/22 22:21:19.629  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Exactly.
2/22 22:21:20.017  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: plenty of rocks around
2/22 22:21:26.533  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: No one was reasonable enough to tell no.
2/22 22:21:28.565  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Someone decided "You know what is a great idea when we are about to capture someone.....let's tell them!"
2/22 22:21:29.250  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Don't yet... Let me check something.
2/22 22:21:32.940  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn finds a small sized rock and offers it to Thalyndrae.
2/22 22:21:39.713  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Aran was!
2/22 22:21:42.201  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Though cleared, it is still a cave.
2/22 22:21:55.082  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal takes a rock from around her and throws it towards Tessa's head softly. She's not a cruel being just making fun of her situation, but she wants to see if time is frozen in her vicinity or only if the druidess appears like that.*
2/22 22:22:03.213  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: And he is the one getting shot. Life just not fair. :D
2/22 22:22:09.765  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: xD
2/22 22:22:14.753  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: THALY
2/22 22:22:17.167  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: FCK YOU.
2/22 22:22:19.767  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: SHE'S DOING SCIENCE
2/22 22:22:25.797  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The rock hits Tessa's head and then stays there.
2/22 22:22:42.501  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Hm, very well... She appears to be frozen, probably in time, but nothing else seems to be.
2/22 22:22:48.302  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: XD
2/22 22:22:57.424  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Though a nifty feature, you think you can remove that spell.
2/22 22:23:03.092  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: It was Arlien idea anyway
2/22 22:23:03.298  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: I approve this science at the moment very much! :P
2/22 22:23:12.070  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: IT WAS ARLIEN IDEA
2/22 22:23:31.259  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Arlien agreed not to do it after Aran complained.
2/22 22:23:44.889  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ...Tessa was already gone !
2/22 22:24:02.360  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: She can do a little more than that
2/22 22:24:23.745  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Vials will do the rest for now. :P
2/22 22:24:30.018  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Nope. Anyways, while Arlien stops him from bleeding to death, I will have tiny afk as he takes a moment.
2/22 22:24:34.761  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: vash is gone for 1 day and we turn into isis stoning people and kidnapping
2/22 22:25:02.677  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* Something is amiss.
2/22 22:25:07.034  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: keeps his guard up, scanning the cave while the others are busy
2/22 22:25:07.593  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Beyond that, the cave is silent.
2/22 22:25:29.293  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* Do you think she was considered a threat?
2/22 22:25:39.278  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn picks her words carefully, it seems.
2/22 22:25:39.793  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* I think it's a trap.
2/22 22:25:53.267  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: *Low* Most likely. How do we proceed
2/22 22:26:54.936  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: An Arcane spell is being prepared, further down the cave. It is not close to Tessaemay.
2/22 22:27:02.201  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: ...
2/22 22:27:04.432  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: More in that direction
2/22 22:27:11.689  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Carefully. I think we might want to search the structure up ahead before we move to check on Tessaemay. One of us could stay an keep an eye out, watch that nothing's done to her.
2/22 22:27:22.026  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: You saw the ping?
2/22 22:27:29.227  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: You saw the ping?
2/22 22:27:33.325  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: To be fair we been kidnapping people while she is around too.
2/22 22:27:34.422  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thoughts?
2/22 22:27:36.764  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nasheen-ArgentDawn: Meanwhile there is nothing to do in Astranaar *cries*
2/22 22:27:41.524  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: Ping?
2/22 22:27:44.410  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: :P
2/22 22:27:44.410  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: What ping?
2/22 22:27:51.299  Nasheen has gone offline.
2/22 22:27:52.758  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: If it can bring you solace, Vash
2/22 22:27:56.405  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: ... She logged.
2/22 22:27:57.161  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: :(
2/22 22:27:59.037  Vashíra has come online.
2/22 22:28:03.340  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: on the minimap
2/22 22:28:09.555  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: Show again please <3
2/22 22:28:10.413  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: mt, ping on the minimap
2/22 22:28:21.493  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: oki 
2/22 22:28:37.322  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: That's where the magic comes from?
2/22 22:29:00.305  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: That is where you sense a spell is being prepared. Over the general sense of magic in this cave
2/22 22:29:12.662  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I don't like the idea of magic messing with the flow of things here, little to be done about it. Searching can be dangerous now that they know we are coming.
2/22 22:29:22.635  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: I can sort of make out {triangle}. Can I see anything?
2/22 22:29:26.649  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *drinks another vial from his belt while Arlien is doing her thing to stop most of the bleeding.*
2/22 22:29:28.906  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: It is a door
2/22 22:29:44.276  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: The structure goes on both levels?
2/22 22:30:07.146  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] True.
2/22 22:30:15.280  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Blue is a wooden structure of its own. The tunnel at green, and at yellow are both blocked by doors
2/22 22:31:00.583  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I mean, we need a backup plan if the seach goes south. 
2/22 22:31:21.113  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Makhalann, Dalathira, check out that structure there.
2/22 22:31:33.637  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/22 22:31:44.410  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss eyes ahead,*"There's a door down below, behind Tessa."
2/22 22:31:48.352  Makhalann-ArgentDawn nods firmly at Arlien, keeping his silence
2/22 22:32:01.835  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Thalyndrae, can you remove that spell on Tessa?
2/22 22:32:02.678  |Kq3|k whispers: I hope they are doin something up there xD
2/22 22:32:06.328  Lyndraé nods at you.
2/22 22:32:08.812  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Most assuredly.
2/22 22:32:11.997  To |Kq3|k: Very, very little
2/22 22:32:17.510  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do so, see what reaction it brings
2/22 22:32:20.902  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Very well...
2/22 22:32:20.902  |Kq3|k whispers: ;-; I'll die from boredom...
2/22 22:32:32.049  To |Kq3|k: As in I came back IC to kick them up the but
2/22 22:32:55.613  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Going to die from your lack of actions, guys.
2/22 22:33:05.578  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do you want me to remain here and shoot anything that moves? Or follow?
2/22 22:33:06.367  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Keep your eyes peeled.
2/22 22:33:14.698  Alyssrea nods at you.
2/22 22:33:15.846  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: approaches {square}, looking at Dalathria "Stay back, more safe" he looks at the structure, trying to see a possible way to open the door
2/22 22:33:21.418  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Wait till she has Tessae cleared, then head on down.
2/22 22:33:42.401  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal stops right in front of Tessaemay and places a hand on her chest. Her eyes and runes glow a bright bronze, even from underneath her clothes and armour, as she tries to remove the spell put upon the youngling.*
2/22 22:33:55.454  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: *The structure is fairly simple in design, and it has a door with a doorknob. There is no sign of a lock on it.*
2/22 22:34:05.948  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn nocks an arrow and keeps her bow ready.
2/22 22:34:24.570  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Though a clever spell, the spell is not very difficult to remove. Movement returns to you, Tessaemay.
2/22 22:34:57.052  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There is a table in the center room. There are a few scattered documents on them. The tree has a central place in the room. It is a small version of Teldrassil, including a miniature version of Darnassus and Rutheran. Prayer candles stand around its edge.
2/22 22:35:01.093  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well, if you didn't get me shot twice... :P
2/22 22:35:02.609  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There are two doors to either side, which are closed. To the side of the door there are a few clossets of Kaldorei make. There are also a number of boxes that show signs of packing.
2/22 22:35:10.023  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: squats, thoughtful, in front of the door with the mace leaning on his knees. He glances at Dalathria "A knob with no lock. I smell traps" he hums, grimly
2/22 22:35:11.250  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Never gonna let it go now. :P
2/22 22:35:17.455  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I did nothing.
2/22 22:35:39.154  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: {star} and {triangle} are doors
2/22 22:36:21.125  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: tilts his head at Dalathria "Indeed, I have no desire to be carved in two pieces by some kind of hellish arcane trickery." he gets up "Let's return and inform the Elder"
2/22 22:36:23.168  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *slowly makes his way over to the edge looking around. For a man shot twice, he looks relativly not in pain anymore*
2/22 22:36:44.331  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Why these ritualistic candles...?
2/22 22:36:50.390  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss joins with Thalyndrae and Tessaemay, smiling at the Valewalker and breathing as sigh of relief,*"Thank Elune"*, she whispers under her breath.*
2/22 22:37:04.827  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It is a memorial.
2/22 22:37:09.801  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn whispers: The spell was at {Star} right
2/22 22:37:23.687  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Yes, beyond that door
2/22 22:37:28.079  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss goes to examine the boxes*
2/22 22:37:35.213  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: That's where the spell is concentrated at, though.
2/22 22:37:38.026  Lyndraé points over yonder.
2/22 22:37:45.859  Alyssrea peers at Lyndraé searchingly.
2/22 22:38:04.018  Irrissia-ArgentDawn pushes on her feet and crosses the room quickly to try to open the door, clearly not ready to wait.
2/22 22:38:15.172  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Tessaemay, don't be rash!
2/22 22:38:20.871  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Follow after her, Thalyndrae.
2/22 22:38:29.740  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The door is open
2/22 22:38:30.681  Lyndraé lets out a long, drawn-out sigh.
2/22 22:38:33.568  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* I guess her cover has been blown now.
2/22 22:38:45.484  Irrissia-ArgentDawn pushes the door and pursue, unless stopped.
2/22 22:39:11.103  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The hallway is lined with a rack of orbs. The orbs lie clearly in pairs, one with a darker shade and the other with sparkles of light inside of them. They are made of clear glass with bronze runes on them. Overhead a statue gazes down on a different level
2/22 22:39:39.460  To Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Above, you feel a teleport spell and then it is gone.
2/22 22:39:41.320  To Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Above, you feel a teleport spell and then it is gone.
2/22 22:39:46.601  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Hold!AOuze!
2/22 22:39:53.510  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Nobody move
2/22 22:40:04.927  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Hands above the keyboards !
2/22 22:40:12.745  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: I swear officer, the weed's not mine!
2/22 22:40:16.076  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Do a little jump back please
2/22 22:40:26.165  [9. Community:159037872:1] Dalathria-ArgentDawn: Indeed it's mine and I won
2/22 22:41:07.530  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: As Tessaemay and Thalyndrae go past the racks, you keep your eyes on the spell above. But you fail to notice a small figure behind the rack.
2/22 22:41:28.669  Yier has gone offline.
2/22 22:41:46.867  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It pushes against the rack, it wobbles for a moment and then it comes crashing down. The orbs float and flicker for a moment and though they fall strangely slow, they fall. The first one cracks and splinters.
2/22 22:41:59.006  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: A shockwave emanates from it, but without sound.
2/22 22:42:19.341  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Then the second one cracks and explodes.
2/22 22:42:59.547  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: As a chain reaction, the orbs all explode. The magic contained within flashes and expands with blue and bronze hues. There are flashes of the past and the present, The cavern rattles and dust falls down.
2/22 22:43:44.850  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: For a moment you feel your lungs fill up with water as the ancient river carves out the cave. Then you breath and the air is clear, your clothes dry. The air is hazy with the amount of magic
2/22 22:44:09.218  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Gah stupid chat didn't work on my Vash char
2/22 22:44:20.607  [Raid Warning] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The dust settles on fallen racks and Thalyndrae and Tessaemay are gone...

2/22 22:45:19.202  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: you're missed here!
2/22 22:45:23.350  |Kq3|k whispers: Do we reappear somewhere precise, dear DM ?
2/22 22:45:24.463  [9. Community:159037872:1] Makhalann-ArgentDawn: bye Vash, have a good night
2/22 22:45:29.093  [9. Community:159037872:1] Vashíra-ArgentDawn: Mostly by bullets at the sound of it xD
2/22 22:45:29.350  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The further away, the less pronounced, but it is a whole lot of magic
2/22 22:45:33.179  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Good bye Vash

2/22 22:46:21.060  Vashíra has gone offline.
2/22 22:46:38.433  Rethion has gone offline.
2/22 22:46:43.729  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *grunts and shakes her head, dazzled from the amount of magic going around* "Gah,,, Foul highborne, you aren't getting away with thi---!" *her black eyes widen as with those flashes Thaly and Tessa were nowhere to be seen* "...Another trap?"
2/22 22:46:59.040  To |Kq3|k: You appear in a forest unknown to you. It takes a moment to orrientate yourself, but you think you see Mount Hyjal to the North West
2/22 22:47:02.072  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *takes a steady footing looking around confusedly for a moment before he slowly looks at the roof of the cave, seeing if there is any danger of anything starting to collapse*
2/22 22:47:24.180  To |Kq3|k: But you are at a place where you would not expect it. You are too far away. And there is no tree
2/22 22:47:45.585  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: growls, feeling the cave shaking. He tries to glance down, to see what happened*
2/22 22:47:48.713  To |Kq3|k: And you have a Goblin straggler with you
2/22 22:48:05.662  |Kq3|k whispers: (Do I need to relay to Thal, or you do it ? And, just a tip : You can put us three in a group and send your emote there)
2/22 22:48:23.903  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: There is dust everywhere, but as it settles down you see Alyssrea and Nitzuss still standing. Though the cave is shaken it seems intact
2/22 22:48:34.585  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss leans against the wall and steadies herself for a moment, retching and trying to keep it in, dazed*
2/22 22:48:57.935  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: But you are at a place where you would not expect it. You are too far away. And there is no tree.
2/22 22:49:16.369  Arlièn-ArgentDawn shakes her head
2/22 22:49:37.155  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Eyes the havoc caused by the explosions and quickly moves up to where Thalyndrae and Tessaemay disappeared*
2/22 22:49:45.768  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Sister, care!
2/22 22:50:00.254  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Don't trigger it again.
2/22 22:51:06.060  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: No trap triggers, there is just the debries of the racks.
2/22 22:51:10.898  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *curses for a moment as he moves on towards the {blue} trying to open to door to the wooden structure*
2/22 22:51:27.390  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: From your position it is difficult to peer into the tunnel
2/22 22:51:39.508  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *follows with her bow ready as she notices the orbs don't start flashing again*
2/22 22:51:57.099  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *As the orbs explose, Tessaeamy moved to cover Thalyndrae, crossing her arms in front of herself as she does, closing her eyes.*
2/22 22:52:03.271  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: hisses a soft curse, seeing nothing from his position. He decides to walk and reach the others
2/22 22:52:14.404  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: It opens up with ease. There are ten bunkbeds, and at the far end there is a desk with a chest sat beside it.
2/22 22:52:27.774  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *rummages through the debris in desperate search for any signs of the two*
2/22 22:52:39.419  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: ou appear in a forest unknown to you. It takes a moment to orrientate yourself, but you think you see Mount Hyjal to the North West
2/22 22:53:05.714  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: But you are at a place where you would not expect it. You are too far away. And there is no tree, but there is a goblin coughing in the sand beside you.
2/22 22:53:41.452  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *moves into the structure looking around for anything of interest as he approaches the chest, likely carefully trying to open it. Ready to dive down to the floor*
2/22 22:53:46.405  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks at the rubbles "Indeed. Move aside" 
2/22 22:53:51.448  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn throws rocks and racks to the side, kicing up dirt.
2/22 22:54:28.357  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: You find nothing. But there is a tiny hidy hole just behind where racks were standing previously.
2/22 22:54:29.455  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They're gone!
2/22 22:54:37.015  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: kneels near the rocks, starting to move them. Efficiently and methodically, his clawed hands tries to move the rubbles away while he works in complete silence
2/22 22:54:44.985  Makhalann kneels down.
2/22 22:54:45.414  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn keeps her weapon ready and looks aroud in expectation that the highborne they were chasing could still be in the cave, or some of their subordinates.
2/22 22:54:55.610  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What's that?
2/22 22:55:00.631  FRIEND_OFFLINE
2/22 22:55:13.698  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn eyes the tiny hole where the racks once stood. She leans in, inspecting it.
2/22 22:55:47.696  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You throw wooden beams and glass shards to a side. But even before you start, you can make out there is nowhere near enough rubble to hide two bodies.
2/22 22:55:55.691  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: It is locked.
2/22 22:56:32.175  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay looks around nervously, her hands sliding on her satchel as she takes a few step, aimlessly.* "Where... how... This is a dream. It-i...it can't be ?"
2/22 22:56:33.118  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Makhalann, they are not here. We must secure the location.
2/22 22:56:40.733  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (Do we have to speak here?)
2/22 22:56:41.358  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: gets up, looking at the rubbles "No way for them to be under here" he looks around, sniffing the air and trying to catch any possible scent
2/22 22:56:44.919  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *not able to find anything, she says,*"They're gone!"*, looking all over until her gaze suddenly halts focused on where the racks stood.*"Waht's that?"*
2/22 22:56:58.198  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *takes the two keys still without use from Auberdine's ruins and tries to open the chest with them*
2/22 22:57:14.112  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: There is a hole, large enough for a goblin. There is a gun and a pouch.
2/22 22:57:25.064  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (Easier for Rob to view what we are doing.)
2/22 22:57:26.838  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: The first one fails, but the second one opens the lock.
2/22 22:57:27.796  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: Any traps? :P
2/22 22:57:35.389  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: please
2/22 22:57:42.876  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (I think the gobelin is like. Near the tree on my right. If you wanna slap him.)
2/22 22:57:44.673  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Mount Hyjal, but... there is no Nordrassil-- Oh, no..."
2/22 22:57:49.488  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "No, no, no, this is bad..."
2/22 22:58:09.379  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (The goblin came with us?)
2/22 22:58:16.436  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (It seems yes xD)
2/22 22:58:34.492  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She glances at Thalyndrae, before taking her friend by the hand, staring at her.* "Take us back !"
2/22 22:58:40.219  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *opens the unlocked chest with again some precaution*
2/22 22:58:44.509  Frolbar has gone offline.
2/22 22:58:51.482  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: You stare into a box that is nearly empty. There is a ledger and a log.
2/22 22:58:53.479  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (I assume Thal's temporal magic is supressed?)
2/22 22:58:55.848  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: No traps
2/22 22:59:04.932  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss would reach into the small hiding hole with one hand. She withdraws a gun and a small pouch the latter of which she opens hastily and looks through*
2/22 22:59:21.729  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You try and the moment you want to visualise it, there is the bronze and blue snap again. It disorientates you
2/22 22:59:40.869  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Thre are the savings of a goblin inside.
2/22 22:59:56.674  [10. xtensionxtooltip2] Draganigo-ArgentDawn: GHI2ChannelReadyCheck
2/22 23:00:00.845  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: You smell nothing
2/22 23:00:07.843  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Well, no new scents of them at least
2/22 23:00:08.301  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers: ooo
2/22 23:00:14.570  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal's eyes glow a bright bronze again, trying to visualize the moment they came from and send them back, but she immediately lets out an ache of pain and staggers back. "The flash, it's disorienting me... I can't see the timeline clearly."
2/22 23:00:20.099  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: A tiny bit of gold.
2/22 23:00:36.575  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Makhalann, Alyssrea, with me. We press on.
2/22 23:00:41.030  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn growls, "Nothing but goblin make!"
2/22 23:00:43.445  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: snorts, rubbing his scarred nose "No traces of them, and my nose rarely is wrong. They are vanished" he nods at Arieln
2/22 23:00:57.262  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay gently pats her friend shoulder* "S-so what... now...?"
2/22 23:01:13.018  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *in his usual manner, takes anything not nailed down from the chest, taking a very quick look at both documents to get an idea what they are as he walks back*
2/22 23:01:20.578  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I...whats happening" The goblin whine"
2/22 23:01:39.470  |Kq3|k whispers: I just realise. You're lucky Tessa was so impatient. xD If not, it would have be more difficult to only aim Tessa and Thaly
2/22 23:01:40.829  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The level overlooked by the statue holds the main study. There are papers stuck to the walls with notes and calculations. This is where the actual work is being done. The shelves are filled with familiar tomes and many more.
2/22 23:01:50.341  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The desks hold tools to do magical calculations with, enchanted hourglasses items to measure the strength of a particular element and alchemical devices sit in the corner.
2/22 23:02:14.115  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I wonder what Keileel is doing
2/22 23:02:16.788  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thalyndrae glares furiously at the goblin and activates her chronomatic enchantments to their fullest as she basically blinks in front of him and grabs him by the throat. "-How- do we get back?"
2/22 23:02:24.418  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Papers now also litter the floor, tomes spilled over from their shelves. Someone seems to have grabbed what they could and left in a hurry.
2/22 23:02:26.886  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Taking his Korean GF to some seat maybe
2/22 23:02:33.006  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: he said he was doing ff14 dungeons yesterday
2/22 23:02:43.680  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: FF14 is nothing but a dead game
2/22 23:02:48.290  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: And he knows it!
2/22 23:02:56.207  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] *low* All their work... within our grasp. But why isn't our target here? Leaving all this behind.
2/22 23:03:12.105  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: then why he doing dungeons
2/22 23:03:19.770  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay clenches her teeth but does very little to help the gobelin.*
2/22 23:03:20.440  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: He is doing solo play
2/22 23:03:31.446  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: The ledger is about the incomes and expenses of the mercenaries. The log is seemingly a personal one, written in dwarvish
2/22 23:03:39.426  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks at the jungle of books and paper, humming thoughtfully 
2/22 23:03:39.426  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *perks his ears a moment looking towards the door rest of the group has gone before he looks around the central room*
2/22 23:03:45.123  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: "Where are we even?"
2/22 23:03:46.106  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: WoW top 5 on twitch atm in views KreyGasm 
2/22 23:03:53.659  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: 7* my bad FeelsBadMAn
2/22 23:04:04.610  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: is it 7th
2/22 23:04:11.052  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: While FF14 cant even get in top 50 KreyGasm
2/22 23:04:11.611  Makhalann-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] they probably alredy took what was of any importance
2/22 23:04:12.156  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: There was some stuff around the room in the bottom. Some papers and a tree?
2/22 23:04:24.414  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: *laughs in #1 MMORPG since 2004!*
2/22 23:04:30.411  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: There is a table in the center. There are a few scattered documents on them. The tree has a central place in the room. It is a small version of Teldrassil, including a miniature version of Darnassus and Rutheran. Prayer candles stand around its edge.
2/22 23:04:35.469  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: There are two doors to either side, which are closed. To the side of the door there are a few clossets of Kaldorei make. There are also a number of boxes that show signs of packing.
2/22 23:04:48.163  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: You got shares in Blizzard or something?
2/22 23:05:00.507  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It might well be a teleportation spell, what Thalyndrae was sensing.
2/22 23:05:01.204  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: nah worse. he's an unpaid simp
2/22 23:05:07.814  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Asmongold is playing again? Ithought he quit, i guess not even he can quit.
2/22 23:05:10.601  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Ugh, you're useless, you're just a mercenary." as she tries to send him flying into the tree and snap some bones.
2/22 23:05:14.729  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *treads foward carefully, skimming for any headlines that jump out.*
2/22 23:05:17.832  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: ... how big is that tree? :P
2/22 23:05:26.894  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I just enjoy playing the #1 MMORPG that was ever created and how many MMORPGS it destroyed along it ways including FF14 KreyGasm
2/22 23:05:29.568  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I think this place is cleared out, Nitzuss, Alyssrea have a look around..
2/22 23:05:36.860  Nitzuss nods at you.
2/22 23:05:39.254  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: Do you enjoy it more because it's number one or?
2/22 23:05:40.842  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Makhalann, can you report back to Arandell?
2/22 23:06:04.925  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Because it has proven it's destiny inside the ranks of God games!
2/22 23:06:10.910  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: It is like a enourmous bonzai tree, Darnassus just at head hight
2/22 23:06:16.693  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *advances further to search around the room, any items of importance, relevant research or alchemical workings which would stick out*
2/22 23:06:22.059  Makhalann-ArgentDawn turns firmly his head to Arlien, nodding. His left eye twitches, crudely "Of course."
2/22 23:06:22.776  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: The doors are the tunnels
2/22 23:06:24.730  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: With Shadowlands still creating WORLD RECORDS! It's no longer  game that Blizzard created, but a gift by GOD itself
2/22 23:06:34.412  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Okay... Bit too big to steal.
2/22 23:06:36.381  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: its me Blizzard, ya boi! Gimme dat fanboi money
2/22 23:06:52.741  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Can you see what is going on in there?
2/22 23:07:03.841  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: didnt you get a fat ban for simping too hard
2/22 23:07:21.247  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Aye and Mr bobby got fired for that
2/22 23:07:28.747  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Billy gates was not pleased with is actions
2/22 23:07:42.224  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: Most of this is way over your head, the level of detail described it incomprehensible.
2/22 23:07:50.264  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *starts by glancing over the documents from the center room and then collecting them as well*
2/22 23:07:52.566  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss inspects the large statue*
2/22 23:08:17.065  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The goblin goes flying and hits his head, he breaks an arm and he goes knock out
2/22 23:08:18.320  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: (or whatever size it is)
2/22 23:08:19.022  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *while stealing all the papers, he looks at Makhalann. "What the bloody heck is going on there?"
2/22 23:08:28.744  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (Can I kill it?)
2/22 23:08:34.615  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Yes
2/22 23:08:44.725  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmmrr... This is like thrown into a foreign land and trying to understand its dynamics. What am I supposed to pick from these?
2/22 23:08:52.911  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: (The documents are notes about supplies and sketches of people and places.)
2/22 23:09:10.353  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: You do find a stack of correspondence that might be interesting.
2/22 23:09:26.549  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm... What is this?
2/22 23:09:40.254  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: The statue has runes enscribed on it. It is very finely made
2/22 23:10:07.154  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Look at this stack.
2/22 23:10:15.104  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: What is it?
2/22 23:10:18.363  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: (ops)
2/22 23:10:20.039  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What is it?
2/22 23:10:28.107  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *shakes his head seeming little dissapointed at the documents, but collects them none the less.*
2/22 23:10:32.435  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn has a look.
2/22 23:10:45.797  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: If you continue looking, you also find a ring with three keys on them.
2/22 23:10:47.682  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Purple is closed door?
2/22 23:11:00.879  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Looks like some sort of stack of correspondence. I can't make out much of anything else here however.
2/22 23:11:13.139  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: On further inspection you will also find another pair of those orbs that first sat on the racks in the hallway.
2/22 23:11:29.966  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thalyndrae, having no one else to fall victim to her elvish feral nature, doesn't even let the goblin off that easily and rushes to him and, infusing her nails with Arcane power, starts trashing the goblin's body until it becomes numb and without any 
2/22 23:11:30.324  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Yes,  it is  locked
2/22 23:11:31.908  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: sort of movement.*
2/22 23:11:43.695  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: What's the stack of correspondence specifically? Like letters back and forth or pattern with similarities?
2/22 23:12:04.432  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She glances at Thalyndrae.* "What are we going to do..."
2/22 23:12:05.835  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: Quickly browsing through the letters, they are raports of updates on the work back and forth to a Willowsheart
2/22 23:12:21.732  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *approaches {purple} door, finding it locked, he tries the remaining mysterious key to unlock it.*
2/22 23:12:48.629  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The Goblins innards are scarred over the tree and its roots. The forest is quiet, serene.
2/22 23:12:50.012  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: follows Arandell
2/22 23:12:51.399  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She slowly makes her way to Thalyndrae, placing her hands on the mage shoulders.*
2/22 23:12:59.752  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: So we fcked with Russia now?
2/22 23:13:09.250  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: EU/US still not doing a thing
2/22 23:13:13.426  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: It does not open. The lock is to refined for this rough key
2/22 23:13:22.926  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn hands Nitzuss the stack of letters, finding more orbs which were in the hallway underneath. "These are addressed to Willowsheart."
2/22 23:13:26.483  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: who cares
2/22 23:13:35.292  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn hmms throughtfully. Upon noticing a ring with some keys attached to, she leans forward to pick it up.
2/22 23:13:38.704  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: Wdym the UK sanctioned 2 people
2/22 23:13:45.722  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: You hear some faint screeches from the other side
2/22 23:14:16.679  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn takes them and places them in her backpack along with the keyring.
2/22 23:14:35.597  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal stops after some time and hangs her head dejectedly, utterly lost.*
2/22 23:14:41.755  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *frowns as the key appears not to fit in, but then leans his ear agains the door. Knocking on it slightly.*
2/22 23:14:54.912  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *carefully reaches towards the orbs on the research tables - would they be of suitable size to be picked up?*
2/22 23:15:03.556  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay wraps her arms around her, muttering softly.* "We will find a way..."
2/22 23:15:16.975  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: There is also a bed, with a box underneath.
2/22 23:15:19.175  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: There is also a bed, with a box underneath.
2/22 23:15:39.782  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: There is no real reaction.
2/22 23:15:57.337  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Well it's ashame
2/22 23:16:20.336  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: same sanctions US did in like 7 years ago smh
2/22 23:16:20.794  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *crouching as she packs her backpack with letter and a keyring, she notices a box underneath a bed. She goes to pull it out and search what's inside.*
2/22 23:16:21.008  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "We need to bury the body, can you call down roots from the earth?"
2/22 23:16:30.136  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks at Arandell "Only good news, tonight" he barks, grimly
2/22 23:16:31.379  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: literally who cares about yank nonsense
2/22 23:16:31.926  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: The orbs are fistsized. The glass is clear but there is a haze inside. On the glass there are bronze lines and runes inscribed
2/22 23:16:46.316  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: its literally on the edge of europe
2/22 23:16:53.098  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: im on the edge of glory
2/22 23:16:56.055  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: IT also shows that EU/US is capable of being touched.
2/22 23:16:59.144  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She nods gently and places a hand to call upon roots of the tree to take the body underground. She mutters a faint prayer to Aessina, in hope the goddess would provide for the lost soul.*
2/22 23:17:00.785  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: and China will move in next.
2/22 23:17:06.485  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: Lmao no

2/22 23:17:15.603  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: There are kaldorei robes in them and a journal.
2/22 23:17:17.114  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: so wrong
2/22 23:17:23.397  [4. LookingForGroup] Keileel-ArgentDawn: Russia carving up parts of Ukraine "yank nonsense"
2/22 23:17:26.730  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Mate taking over a full country and no real consequence? Mate it shows we have nothing to say in this anymore.
2/22 23:17:32.625  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: 'who cares it doesnt affect me' is the attitude that's allowed russia to be so ballsy
2/22 23:17:40.067  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: Its all yank nonsense
2/22 23:17:42.972  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: *gives Nitzuss the orbs and joins her studying the box under the bed*
2/22 23:17:46.884  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Putler should retire
2/22 23:18:00.458  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *moves bit behind Makhalann taking out his pistol and motioning Dalathria to be ready as well.*
2/22 23:18:13.723  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: approaches {purple}, putting both of his clawed hands on it. He flexes a bit his shoulders, before coiling the claws into fists and smashing both of them against the door's hinges
2/22 23:18:14.309  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: *nocks an arrow and leans on the wall, looking towards the door cautiously.*
2/22 23:18:26.325  [4. LookingForGroup] Shanklin-ArgentDawn: Putin is doing this because he is retiring. Going out with a bang for the motherland
2/22 23:18:29.524  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Tbf they should just cut off Russians of anything western related, Websites, Games, Serieplatforms like netflix etc etc
2/22 23:18:36.324  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: It is difficult to call on the roots. They are allien to you and almost unwilling to react. As though they are not used to such a call
2/22 23:18:38.264  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Make them crumble back to 1900's
2/22 23:19:04.003  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: we should do that to the americans too
2/22 23:19:05.950  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *withdraws a few kaldorei robes, gently folding the orbs into them before placing it in her backpack, which is now full. Finally she lifts a journal up before her, blowing dust off its covers*
2/22 23:19:09.819  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Did they officially start invading yet or just the Russian controlled part?
2/22 23:19:12.305  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: america bad

2/22 23:19:31.946  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: chyner bad
2/22 23:19:34.318  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Power stations? Inside Ukraine ?
2/22 23:19:43.746  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: yep cutting off people's power and water
2/22 23:19:45.503  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: I've not heard anything from the Ukrainians about this, literally just EU/NA malding
2/22 23:19:46.734  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *shows the journal to Alyssrea*
2/22 23:19:50.321  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *Tessaemay blinks and shakes her head, before taking a flower from her crown, and planting it to grow roots without being forced to use the unwilling tree to fulfill her work.*
2/22 23:19:52.819  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: thats not true Aesyla

2/22 23:20:01.223  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: The door shakes and shudders. The hinges groan but it is a sturdy door. The first strikes do not topple it, but after you repeatedly strike it the door comes loose with bloodspatters from your knuckles on them.
2/22 23:20:02.077  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Who u wanna hear it from Edderon?
2/22 23:20:03.839  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: "We should get this to the others."

2/22 23:21:02.894  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: Do you know alchemy?
2/22 23:21:05.157  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: we didnt free hong kong, least we can do is protect ukraine
2/22 23:21:13.203  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Whatever gets the job done.

2/22 23:21:15.773  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Because we let dictatorship countries take over the world

2/22 23:21:24.316  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Countries that have 0 value in human lives or freedom of speech, that have nazi camps
2/22 23:21:28.670  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: the US
2/22 23:21:29.912  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Dude nothing like US fck of bro

2/22 23:21:50.825  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: the US has issues but its definitely not russia level
2/22 23:21:53.389  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: You look into a room, that on one end is filled with more magical devices. Lenses and dials that peer through a slit in the walls. The rod you carry glows once more and you see the illusion drop.
2/22 23:21:58.486  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: tell me where in china or russia?
2/22 23:21:59.500  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: And i mean legit to camps.

2/22 23:22:19.842  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Further down the room, you hear the screaches again.
2/22 23:22:20.925  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: chyner bad
2/22 23:22:32.153  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: why you all so obsessed with yanks its weird
2/22 23:22:34.630  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Aly knows some but not enough to make out details. Which is why she would bring those samples to the group, knowing that Arandell might make better sense of it
2/22 23:22:41.443  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *peers past Makhalann into the room before saying. "Take point, brother."*
2/22 23:22:48.913  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: If you really think a world dominated by China & Russia is good, then ur legit not good in the head
2/22 23:22:51.431  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: But there is no gunshot, no trap, no other sign of life but for the screeches.
2/22 23:22:51.999  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: for someone so pissed at america you sure think everything is their fault
2/22 23:23:02.627  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: have fun losing any rights you have ;)
2/22 23:23:08.500  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I will be right behind...

2/22 23:23:18.791  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: You going to sign up for the Ukranian Defence Force Gim?
2/22 23:23:21.681  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: frees his mace from his back, gripping it. "Swift and strong. We go in"
2/22 23:23:27.467  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Since 2018 no one is allowed to protest in Russia, Most people are too afraid to tell their opinion in Russia
2/22 23:23:30.111  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Yet russia is good ;)

2/22 23:23:59.803  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: because you dont hear doesnt make it not true, maybe watch other than US media lel
2/22 23:24:03.175  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: US has freedom of speech, something Russia & China dont have. If you open your mouth there like you do in here, you would be probably in camp or dead by now.
2/22 23:24:05.486  [4. LookingForGroup] Socias-ArgentDawn: take ur politics back to elwynn forest general chat

2/22 23:24:29.227  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Lel can't think of anything ur own huh
2/22 23:24:29.887  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: At {cross} and {triangle} are two huge cages. You think them empty for a moment, but then you hear the screetches again.
2/22 23:24:38.078  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: china bad !!

2/22 23:25:03.962  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Mount Hyjal without Nordrassil... That sounds like a good guess. Given the area is shrouded in what seems like eternal autumn, I'll also assume we are in Azshara..."
2/22 23:25:09.204  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: am not surprised
2/22 23:25:14.030  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Seems like you are falling from the propaganda lol

2/22 23:26:05.445  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Only you
2/22 23:26:05.894  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Accepts the hand with her own bloodied one. "It depends when -exactly- we are. How far back before the Sundering..."
2/22 23:26:09.578  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: never have
2/22 23:26:13.512  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Sure sounds like it

2/22 23:26:29.962  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "I doubt the forest will tell us, so... We should try to find a city, maybe ?"
2/22 23:26:29.962  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Imagine thinking US is the worst outcome out of the 3. Sounds pretty stupid tbh.
2/22 23:26:32.603  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: you just dont get that there isnt just two sides. typical yank
2/22 23:26:42.301  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Let's find the Academy."
2/22 23:26:43.486  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: You think posting in LFG on a 20 year old MMO is going to stop Putin?
2/22 23:26:47.215  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: ignore him gim, he's just a troll at this point
2/22 23:26:47.690  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Makhalann looks through a large telescope, that peers down on Auberdine. It has runes and magical incantation written on it. What you see, other than the buildings, you can not quite comprehent
2/22 23:26:47.690  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: ^
2/22 23:26:51.990  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: ^ to both of those 
2/22 23:26:58.338  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "The Academy... Is it a good idea ?"
2/22 23:27:01.740  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: I know he is, i know him. he isn't the brightest tool in town
2/22 23:27:13.628  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: dont come on LFG pretending to be a beacon of political knowledge and not expecting backlash
2/22 23:27:18.786  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "I don't want to enter, but if it exists, it means we're not that far back."
2/22 23:27:20.258  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *Nitzuss approaches Arandell, offering him the journal and the keyring.*"Found this on the other side"
2/22 23:27:26.042  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: Go join the Ukranian army
2/22 23:27:29.216  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: staggers away from the telescope, hissing a soft curse about arcane and trickery. He glances at Arandell, pointing to the cages 
2/22 23:27:30.360  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "Oh. Right."
2/22 23:27:40.112  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Once WW3 starts i prob be in the army 
2/22 23:27:47.723  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: Lmaooooo
2/22 23:27:47.980  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: All tho i doubt it goes that far
2/22 23:28:01.853  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: someone needs to clean the toilets I suppose
2/22 23:28:02.386  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: One of the rings matches the lock on the door. The other two are bronze with silver runes.
2/22 23:28:06.467  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Bingo
2/22 23:28:24.367  To Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: There is one fancy ring, that seemed to match this architecture. The other two rings are bronze with silver runes.
2/22 23:28:51.650  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: Imagine not having a job to important to avoid being drafted
2/22 23:28:57.012  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *nods slowly at Nitzuss while taking the items, first looking at the keys briefly before opening the journal for a brief glance at first and last page as he slowly walks towards the cages.*
2/22 23:28:59.580  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: blergh
2/22 23:29:02.539  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "So... if it's founded. It will only narrows it down to almost four thousands years of possibility..."
2/22 23:29:04.066  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: ye he needs to have a job for that
2/22 23:29:05.338  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: 'beacon of political knowledge' doesnt believe china has prison camps
2/22 23:29:10.197  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What sort of trickery? What did you see?
2/22 23:29:15.054  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Three thousand five hundred..."
2/22 23:29:22.412  |Kq3|k whispers: Btw, do you need the exact date where we went back ?
2/22 23:29:23.312  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "At the very maximum."
2/22 23:29:23.312  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: why are you defending the US so much? go live there
2/22 23:29:40.397  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "Sure, five hundred makes a major difference..."
2/22 23:29:47.724  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: not just the clown, you're the entire circus or however it goes
2/22 23:29:48.711  Makhalann-ArgentDawn hums "Mostly buildings, but... they were strange. Made my skin crawls, I cannot explain better"
2/22 23:29:59.713  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Well, we might be stuck here for that time, so good to know you think so."
2/22 23:30:00.255  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: Hahaha ok calm down tho
2/22 23:30:01.144  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Casting a closer look to the cages, you can find hidden away in the shadows two welps.
2/22 23:30:02.712  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: mate there has been chinese citizens even claiming it
2/22 23:30:13.836  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: idc if u troll, just don't be a fool
2/22 23:30:16.497  To Makhalann-ArgentDawn: Timewimy,wobbly magic stuff.
2/22 23:30:21.998  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: It's not true, trolling or not. just CIA lies
2/22 23:30:31.780  Makhalann-ArgentDawn whispers: I was searching a more Mak way to say it
2/22 23:30:34.648  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Tell that about anyone who just suddenly goes away.
2/22 23:30:37.277  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Uuh...
2/22 23:30:39.510  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: *opens up her backpack and shows the robes as well, within their folds lie a number of orbs,*"Alyssrea found these. Orbs like were what caused the blast earlier"
2/22 23:30:39.510  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: like the US?
2/22 23:30:39.896  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Like that rich Chinese guy? what was his name again?
2/22 23:30:42.111  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I see...
2/22 23:30:45.620  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Nothing like US but okay. 
2/22 23:30:47.420  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: Epstein?
2/22 23:31:01.892  Makhalann-ArgentDawn looks at the orbs, squinting his lone eye
2/22 23:31:09.734  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Epstein or a whole nation getting sent to concetration camps is a whole diff league bro
2/22 23:31:22.468  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: literally not true
2/22 23:31:25.284  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: You want Arlièn back in for this?
2/22 23:31:29.083  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: cia shill
2/22 23:31:40.272  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No wierd gems or the like? All well and good but we lost both who know about these things...
2/22 23:31:43.716  [4. LookingForGroup] Aesyla-ArgentDawn: the irony of calling him a shill while denying atrocities
2/22 23:31:53.790  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "...That's not funny, Thaly. We can't... be stuck here for so long !"
2/22 23:31:58.560  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: How is it not true?
2/22 23:32:08.711  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: A couple of instruments
2/22 23:32:08.711  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: To deal with whelps, the rumored dragon might be best.
2/22 23:32:09.931  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: Google it
2/22 23:32:11.032  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: Muh Alex Jones
2/22 23:32:25.400  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: So you compare anyone who is Muslim or Black gets automatically send into camps to a Pedophile ?
2/22 23:32:25.687  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal shrugs faintly.* "We'll be stuck here until the others track us down. If they do..."
2/22 23:32:33.964  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: where did I?
2/22 23:32:35.411  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: But was the journals first and last page of any interest?
2/22 23:32:44.113  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: And for Russia Also china, LGBTQ+, Gay, anyone who isnt "Normal" gets either killeed or send to camps
2/22 23:32:48.144  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: How is this even compareable.
2/22 23:32:51.800  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: who compared
2/22 23:32:57.673  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: You did, since you said US is just as bad.
2/22 23:33:03.487  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: i compared to your china 'dissapearing people!!' story
2/22 23:33:06.387  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: re-read bro
2/22 23:33:12.176  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "There might be a way to help you to recover your sight ! We can't be stuck here ! Imagine if we are stuck here DURING the sundering !"
2/22 23:33:16.331  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: Which those people do too though ?
2/22 23:33:22.156  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: the US do yeah
2/22 23:33:32.533  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: The first page writes a cheerful tune about the idea of Teldrassil being raised. The sentences are long and elaborate.
2/22 23:33:41.410  [4. LookingForGroup] Edderon-ArgentDawn: Guys, while you are arguing Russian tanks are rolling into Ukrainian territory! 
2/22 23:33:41.827  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "I don't have to imagine, there were quite a few cases of time travelers stuck here during the Sundering. For some reason, it's quite a hot spot for aberrations."
2/22 23:33:46.610  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: oh no!
2/22 23:33:50.311  [4. LookingForGroup] Luke-ArgentDawn: someone blame China!

2/22 23:34:07.056  Arandell-ArgentDawn whispers: Not of interest to Aran at the moment. What is the last thing written?
2/22 23:34:23.415  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: The last is a short message on the state of the experiment: "Kin are causing trouble. Experiment is in danger."
2/22 23:34:32.285  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She stops walking, frozen, shaking deeply.*
2/22 23:34:46.781  [4. LookingForGroup] Gimlix-ArgentDawn: There have yet tanks to roll in actual territory so far i am aware off though
2/22 23:34:50.182  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] All this to bring Teldrassil back? 
2/22 23:35:07.569  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal stops in her tracks and comes to Tessa, taking her hands in her own. "Whatever happens, I'll take care of you. Come."
2/22 23:35:09.469  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *closes the journal eyes the whelps in the cages*
2/22 23:35:14.056  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "N-no... We... We can't... be there. There must be... a way b-back." *She mutters, her eyes widdening slightly as she gets overwhelmed.
2/22 23:35:20.884  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (bronze, I am assuming.)
2/22 23:35:30.067  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Bronze dragons, indeed.
2/22 23:35:32.957  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (ayo fam c-can I borrow one of them)
2/22 23:35:44.240  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] The more we learn about this, the more I'm feeling that the highborne are causing more harm than good with their project.
2/22 23:35:58.827  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She raises her gaze on Thalyndrae, freeing her hands, only to pass them around Thalyndrae's neck, brusting in cries.*
2/22 23:36:00.055  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (.... Kill the highborne third time tonight!)
2/22 23:36:06.083  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (ARANDELL)
2/22 23:36:17.383  Arandell-ArgentDawn looks over his shoulder.
2/22 23:36:30.112  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: *Thal embraces Tessa softly. "We'll be fine..."*
2/22 23:36:35.000  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Arlièn gasps when she comes in from the other room, shocked to see the whelps in cages. She hurries over to the bars to have a better look at them and she says a few words in draconinc.
2/22 23:36:36.284  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Arlien, you are best at talking to dragons?
2/22 23:36:52.213  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Take that as a yes.
2/22 23:36:55.927  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "I-I want to go back..." *She escapes, among her sobs.*
2/22 23:37:11.971  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: (*waves at Thalyndrae. "Hello!")
2/22 23:37:22.242  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "We both do. But first, we must understand when we are so we can conjure up a plan."
2/22 23:37:32.694  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Dalathria-ArgentDawn: (You can call it a trade. One whelp for one highborne head.)
2/22 23:37:49.752  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She sniffs softly, cleaning her face, looking up at Thalyndrae, with a faint nod.*
2/22 23:38:10.941  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (I need that higborne, guys.)
2/22 23:38:10.941  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Arlièn speaks a few words with both welps, that seem to be responding with soft cries and screetches of their own. They slowly come out of their corners and closer to Arlièn that begins to heal them.
2/22 23:38:30.301  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Come, let us see..."
2/22 23:38:41.150  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Can we get these cages open?
2/22 23:38:42.005  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn whispers, "Madness.."
2/22 23:39:14.955  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: *She follows, keeping Thalyndrae's hand in hers, clearly distressed by the situation.* "I didn't tell Selrian where I was going... A-and Ellemayne will be alone..."
2/22 23:39:15.168  Arandell-ArgentDawn hands the keyring over to Arlien.
2/22 23:39:18.926  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Try those.
2/22 23:39:42.907  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "We don't know for how long. For all we know, mere seconds passed so far."
2/22 23:39:56.394  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: "Or it's already been a year..."
2/22 23:40:02.629  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: "Let us be optimistic..."
2/22 23:40:08.491  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Arlièn accepts the keyring from Arandell, and she opens up one of the cages. The first key fails, but the second clicks and the welp comes flying out. It lands at Arlièn side with a whimper.
2/22 23:40:09.684  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (I assume Mennar is still standing given they're not that far back?)
2/22 23:40:40.600  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Look at this fucker
2/22 23:40:44.473  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Arlièn quickly looks it over and with a hum and a word in draconic, walks over to the other cage to open that one as well.
2/22 23:40:47.446  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Want to play it as if Aly followed for the rest of the evening or should I create an IC excuse to run out? I gotta start preparing for bed ._.)
2/22 23:40:54.481  [9. Community:159037872:1] Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: Lil cunt
2/22 23:41:04.534  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: I mean
2/22 23:41:04.751  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: Wait, we will wrap it here.
2/22 23:41:08.806  [9. Community:159037872:1] Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: rofl
2/22 23:41:09.150  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: FREE MOGS ? hell yes.
2/22 23:41:18.717  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: *eyes the whelp carefully, before concluding it is not going to bite anyone.*
2/22 23:41:18.721  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn whispers: Oki!
2/22 23:41:24.892  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Would have to check on stuff for that bit
2/22 23:41:45.678  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: (I would say yes, as we are suppose to be in -10.868)
2/22 23:41:47.235  |Hchannel:PARTY|h[Party]|h Lyndraé-ArgentDawn: (Mennar is one of the first academies of the Arcane so its safe to say it began around 13500 years ago)
2/22 23:41:58.466  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] We need to get these away from here. And we need someone to take a better look at this cave, someone who knows what might be up.
2/22 23:42:25.892  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Think the two for that are missing.
2/22 23:42:26.580  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Arlièn picks up one of the whelps and looks at its wing, humming softly.
2/22 23:42:37.786  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Indeed, so we must find someone else.
2/22 23:42:47.547  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Who else would like a way out, to get to bed?
2/22 23:42:50.962  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Aran should be jelly now. :P
2/22 23:42:56.562  Nitzuss-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Do you think Winterflow might be of use in that regard?
2/22 23:43:18.981  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: We'll just have you guard the outpost for the time being
2/22 23:43:37.377  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: I do intend to wrap up, so thank you all for comming and I hope you had fun
2/22 23:44:01.659  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Makhalann-ArgentDawn: first event after a break, and I had a lot of fun. Thanks Rob
2/22 23:44:04.473  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well Aran is likely going to take a look through the telescope still, but that is about it.
2/22 23:44:19.704  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid Leader]|h Arlièn-ArgentDawn: If you want to find a quick way out, you can either stay here, or join Arlièn to the Hermitage where she will look after the whelps and probably the injured
2/22 23:44:23.002  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Arandell-ArgentDawn: And then take the telescope.
2/22 23:44:47.371  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I can help bringing the whelps back and set out to guard our camp.
2/22 23:45:01.342  |Hchannel:RAID|h[Raid]|h Nitzuss-ArgentDawn: Thanks Rob :) Always great, had a lot of fun!
2/22 23:45:01.854  [4. LookingForGroup] Druwuid-ArgentDawn: Still LF dps for fate & Tarra hc
2/22 23:45:02.573  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: There are a few different devices, the telescope pointed at Auberdine shows magic and time stuff around it.
2/22 23:45:11.377  To Arandell-ArgentDawn: Another was pointed at Teldrassil, for research
2/22 23:45:25.637  To Alyssrea-ArgentDawn: This is the outpost, the observatory
