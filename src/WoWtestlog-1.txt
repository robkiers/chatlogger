2/14 12:01:19.000  Alyssrea-ArgentDawn » sorrow.
2/14 12:01:20.000  Annaeya-ArgentDawn | The silver winged moth sits upon Tessaemay's finger, fluttering those beautiful reflective wings.

2/14 23:41:04.980  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Looks like a siege soon.
2/14 23:41:25.622  Annaeya-ArgentDawn is quite well concealed, more than a year of hiding in bushes has left her in good stead, one would need to be -in- the bush to see past her camouflage.  Though if one listens, one can hear strangled chuckles. 
2/14 23:41:33.346  Irrissia-ArgentDawn shakes her head softly and moves next to Thalyndrae.
2/14 23:41:40.914  Lyndraé gently pats Irrissia.
2/14 23:41:52.351  Irrissia-ArgentDawn grabs the patting hand, to hold it. Mine.
2/14 23:41:57.532  Aseasia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Is there.. a commotion with the bush?
2/14 23:41:57.911  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and dips her head to Aseasia in greeting, before she looks back to the bush.
2/14 23:42:03.397  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn has no choice.
2/14 23:42:30.067  Aseasia-ArgentDawn returns a nod towards Arlien.
2/14 23:42:31.545  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Producing very unusual sounds and berries, that really should not be growing.
2/14 23:42:31.545  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: How are you feeling?
2/14 23:43:00.613  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "Tired..."
2/14 23:43:16.930  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: There's a general solution to that conundrum; it's called sleep.
2/14 23:43:27.868  Annaeya-ArgentDawn careflly reaches up, attempting to tuck a few daisies into one of Dalathria's boots without being noticed. 
2/14 23:43:29.089  Irrissia-ArgentDawn squints, looking at Thalyndrae Ravenshade.
2/14 23:43:36.649  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: And you are the one telling about it ?
2/14 23:43:37.458  Arandell-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am expecting crickets or some other bugs flying about.
2/14 23:43:47.152  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Precisely. Do what I say, not what I do.
2/14 23:43:55.105  Dalathria-ArgentDawn glances over her shoulder towards the unknown voice and inclines her head to Aseasia slightly.
2/14 23:44:24.964  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: You know it doesn't work well with me.
2/14 23:44:52.906  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Sleep might though.
2/14 23:44:54.749  Annaeya-ArgentDawn does not reveal herself,  despite having been well and truly rumbled. 
2/14 23:44:56.891  Faeraven-ArgentDawn shrieks playfully and hastens her flight. She swoops agilely across the air and changes her directions unpredictably, enjoying the chase.
2/14 23:45:05.610  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her gaze, mumbling faintly.
2/14 23:45:07.385  Dalathria-ArgentDawn eventually turns her attention back to the bush, paying little attention to her boots.
2/14 23:45:28.928  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn leans to mumble back.
2/14 23:45:37.213  Annaeya-ArgentDawn continues to decorate Dalathria's boots, one little daisy and buttercup at a time.
2/14 23:45:59.219  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods faintly.
2/14 23:46:06.604  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Low] Likely.
2/14 23:46:29.186  Aseasia-ArgentDawn makes her up closer to the bush.
2/14 23:46:30.980  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] When you are done there, will you come out?
2/14 23:46:31.826  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: Well, I'm not leaving anytime soon, so there's that.
2/14 23:46:34.424  Lyndraé shrugs at Irrissia. Who knows?
2/14 23:47:15.049  Annaeya-ArgentDawn ponders Arlien's query. One last flower is added to Dalathria's boot before she utters. "Nope!"
2/14 23:47:25.232  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods again, her focus switchin on the bush a moment.
2/14 23:47:33.304  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Low] What's the problem, with the bush...?
2/14 23:47:40.696  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] No as in you are not done yet, or no you will not come out?
2/14 23:48:05.853  Annaeya-ArgentDawn manages to hear Tessaemay despite her low voice. Good ears, this elf. "The bush is haunted!"
2/14 23:48:20.836  Lyndraé-ArgentDawn says: I think it came to life, but I'm not sure.
2/14 23:48:33.749  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Not another water spirit?
2/14 23:48:34.294  Annaeya-ArgentDawn says: No I am not done and no I will not come out... so... both!
2/15 00:01:35.749  Shalaira-ArgentDawn yells: Awwooooh!

3/1 12:00:00.000  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "Tired..."
11/1 12:00:00.000  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "Tired..."
12/15 12:00:00.000  Irrissia-ArgentDawn mutters faintly. "Tired..."
