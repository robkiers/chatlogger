4/21 23:41:47.017  Irrissia-ArgentDawn is focused on a large bush growing in front of her, as she chants quietly, melancolic.

4/21 23:43:01.441  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What nightmare brought you here tonight?
4/21 23:43:54.581  Irrissia-ArgentDawn idly glances at Arlien, remaining 'silent' a moment, just enough to finish her song. She lowers her hands on her laps, and can't restict a long sigh. "I just... needed a quiet place."
4/21 23:45:48.371  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] At the gate? Near the Dreams paths.
4/21 23:46:08.757  Irrissia-ArgentDawn lowers her eyes, observing her hands. "Isn't a quiet place ?"
4/21 23:46:42.898  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums a quiet tone, weaving an unseen string together and casting it out again. She stares to a space where there is nothing before looking back to Tessaemay.
4/21 23:47:17.348  Irrissia-ArgentDawn whispers: Oh great, Arlien is crazy too :p It's not only Tessa anymore
4/21 23:47:28.752  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I assume it can be.
4/21 23:48:26.363  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "You were not in Moonglade...?"
4/21 23:49:28.783  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I was there. But now I am near.
4/21 23:50:08.177  Irrissia-ArgentDawn gestures next to her, to invite Arlien to sit. "For a short time, I take...?"

4/21 23:52:32.768  Irrissia-ArgentDawn hums softly, grabbing her knees and hugging them. "...I miss you, you know ?"

4/21 23:53:57.328  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says:[Darnassian] I am still here. I heard your call.
4/21 23:54:39.186  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] My call...?
4/21 23:56:30.193  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It rang out. I try not to pry
4/21 23:57:10.969  Irrissia-ArgentDawn nods slowly. "I just... I wanted to not snap."
4/21 23:57:48.253  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Vashira and Arandell were not... stopping to speak, and insist, and... dig deeper and deeper, and I felt like I was about to scream but at the same time, I wanted to stay silent.

4/21 23:58:11.123  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So I just... left. To find some calm, in the forest.
4/21 23:58:58.340  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] You are calmer than you would have been a few months ago.
4/21 23:59:22.200  Irrissia-ArgentDawn glances at Arlien. "I grew up."
4/22 00:01:11.415  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It still amazes me. It was only such a short time, that it almost fades in an instant.
4/22 00:01:38.006  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums, frowns and waves her hand through the air. She shakes her head and settles back in place.
4/22 00:01:44.153  Irrissia-ArgentDawn sighs deeply. "It was not for me... Which just make the current situation worst, probably."
4/22 00:01:56.104  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Are you alright...?
4/22 00:02:03.420  Irrissia-ArgentDawn covers Arlien with a worried gaze.
4/22 00:02:45.815  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I am well.

4/22 00:03:45.900  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Just a thought that past me by.
4/22 00:04:02.280  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Care to share it...?
4/22 00:04:34.789  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Hmm, how best to describe it.
4/22 00:06:09.262  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] A flower falls and the child flies. She is scared and it turns to glee.
4/22 00:06:37.331  Irrissia-ArgentDawn tilts her head, expecting a little more explanations.
4/22 00:07:56.576  Arlièn-ArgentDawn hums and raises her shoulders in a shrug. "It is not our Dream."
4/22 00:08:02.712  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But will you speak of yours?
4/22 00:08:17.336  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] It was not a dream...

4/22 00:10:50.608  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Reality.
4/22 00:11:01.516  Irrissia-ArgentDawn idly rubs her skirt.
4/22 00:11:04.463  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What took place there.
4/22 00:11:34.171  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I... discovered that Thalyndrae did not give up on Necromancy as she promised me, a couple of months after we met...

4/22 00:12:19.141  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I came back home earlier today, and caught her reading a forbidden tome. I... I could have excused it from anyone else. But she had... She had a background of active necromancer. She used it. I just couldn't let it slide.
4/22 00:12:48.418  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] So I... I chased her. Of my house, of the Hermitage... *She grows more sorrowful* Of... my life...
4/22 00:12:52.338  Arlièn-ArgentDawn frowns and looks at Tessaemay a little more closely, her gaze staying fixed for a good while longer.
4/22 00:13:47.028  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But when I shared that with Arandell and Vashira, they... they dragged me to report to Commander Ravenmist, and now they want to call the wardens... But I just... I can't bring myself to send wardens after my min'da. I already turn on my blood mother. »
4/22 00:13:47.393  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] » I can't do the same again.

4/22 00:15:15.656  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They just insisted again and again without understanding how I felt...

4/22 00:19:27.307  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Irrissia-ArgentDawn: You didn't realise ?
4/22 00:19:33.200  |Hchannel:GUILD|h[Guild]|h Plainberry-ArgentDawn: No
4/22 00:19:49.479  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] To make true...?
4/22 00:20:08.474  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] What would you like to do?
4/22 00:20:20.491  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] There is not much I can do...
4/22 00:20:34.066  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] They want to report to wardens and prey I come back to my senses later, when I feel better.
4/22 00:20:54.326  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I send my blood mother in the hands of the kirin tor. I sent Denarus in the hands of the wardens... I can't do it again.
4/22 00:22:41.864  Arlièn-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] Study does not equate the act of doing so.
4/22 00:22:58.205  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Just the default question by now "Where you sober?" :D

4/22 00:23:14.738  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Where.
4/22 00:23:16.968  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Not Were.
4/22 00:23:20.412  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Meaning even more.
4/22 00:23:32.133  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Details... But yes. Were.
4/22 00:24:03.421  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Isn't the default assumption that the answer is no?
4/22 00:24:30.576  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: Well, it was to Reori so you tell me. :P
4/22 00:24:32.920  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I know her, Arlien... She does not study just for curiosity.
4/22 00:24:40.220  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] She gathers powers to be able to use them.
4/22 00:24:52.490  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] I know she would not hesitate to use it, if she had to.
4/22 00:24:54.166  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arandell-ArgentDawn: But it starts to look like it could just apply to half of the people around.
4/22 00:25:34.244  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] But I can't wrap my head around turning her to the wardens. I just... can't. We've been chased by one for five years. And I visited their prisons, I know how it looks, how it is. I just... I can't.

4/22 00:28:02.617  Irrissia-ArgentDawn says: [Darnassian] And if I... if I call her out, why would I refuse to help the wardens to find her ? It would make no sense.

4/22 00:28:23.075  [9. Community:159037872:1] Plainberry-ArgentDawn: Where was I sober
4/22 00:28:27.377  [9. Community:159037872:1] Plainberry-ArgentDawn: My birth
4/22 00:28:39.624  [9. Community:159037872:1] Irrissia-ArgentDawn: Your kitchen, maybe.
4/22 00:29:30.301  [9. Community:159037872:1] Arlièn-ArgentDawn: Can't you be born drunk, if the mother is a heavy drinker too?
